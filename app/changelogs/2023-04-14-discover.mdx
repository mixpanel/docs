Our new Discover feature makes it easier to explore popular analyses to springboard your own work. The Discover page automatically surfaces top analyses and creators and provides more search controls to filter reports & Boards.

<div style={{position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '64.90384615384616%', height: 0}}>
    <iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/5353fc9abb624e2685d787f43b003dc2"
        frameBorder="0"
        webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowFullScreen
        style={{position: 'absolute', 'top': 0, 'left': 0, 'width': '100%', 'height': '100%'}}>
    </iframe>
</div>

Here are a few ways to use Discover:

* Find existing analyses: filter searches by the teammate or object type (Board, Insights, Flows, etc.). Build off someoneâ€™s previous work instead of redoing an analysis.
* Onboard new teammates: new people can quickly get their bearings by discovering the most popular analyses, or by exploring what top builders in the organization are measuring.
* Get inspired: browse what your teammates measure or how they organize their Boards, and be inspired to create similar high-quality analyses
