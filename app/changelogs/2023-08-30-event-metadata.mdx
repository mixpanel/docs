Our latest data governance improvement makes it easier to investigate and fix data discrepancies, with peace of mind that you’re not disrupting your team’s workflows.

You can now see event usage context in Lexicon, such as:

- Who first queried an event?
- When was it first tracked?
- Which people queried it most recently? When?

With this event metadata, data teams can not only sort events to identify your highest volume / least queried events, but also identify relevant stakeholders to confirm whether this event is still necessary. 

Less fear of disrupting the team, less time spent cleaning data.
