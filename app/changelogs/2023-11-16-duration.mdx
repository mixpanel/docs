Tracking the number of views your website pages get is a useful way to learn if users have landed on your page. But, it doesn’t tell the complete story of whether these users got value from their visit:

- Your blog might have 100s of views, but how do you know if users are actually reading all the content?
- Users are reaching your signup page, but are they moving through that experience quickly or getting stuck?
- Two different pages are getting similar views, but one is converting more sales than the other - are users finding content more engaging on that page?

The missing piece of the puzzle is understanding how long users visit your page, and to access this data **we’ve added a *Duration* property on your *Page View* event** that tracks your users’ “time spent on a page”. 

It takes no additional setup — *Duration* is auto-computed by calculating the time between *Page View* events. 

Checkout the video above to learn how you can answer questions like:

- What blog content are our users finding the most engaging? (find the average time spent on blog pages)
- Which pages are users not finding any value from? (find the pages that have an average visit time of less than 10 seconds)
