You can now see rich context about an event, such as an image of the event, frequent users, reports that query it, or an owner for follow-up questions. With these contextual details, teams can build reports more quickly by trusting that theyâ€™re using the right event.

Types of Event Context now available:
- Embedded image of the event
- Teammates that recently queried the event
- Other reports that query the event
- Event Owner, who you can contact for follow-up questions

In addition to having easy access to this context via the query builder, you can also leverage Event Context throughout the product. You can filter the Discover page to see existing analyses about an event.

Event Context is available for all customers on all plans.
