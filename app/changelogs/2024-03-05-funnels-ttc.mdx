Understanding how long it takes users to do actions or convert is key in building an efficient product that gets users to value fast, or, timing marketing strategies.
We’ve improved this analysis by opening up new ways to answer questions on the time it takes users to complete a series of actions — this is made possible with our new expanded functionality of [TTC in Funnels](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/reports/funnels#time-to-convert).

Now, you can measure the amount of time it takes a user to convert in **all of our aggregations** (Average, Median, Percentile, Min & Max) to learn whether the adjustments to a workflow are decreasing the friction it takes to get to a moment of value. 
- Who are the users that look the lowest amount of time to signup after viewing our new landing page?

Can also bucket any of these funnel metrics by the Time To Convert on the whole funnel or a certain step.
- How many users converted through our signup funnel based on how quickly they went from step 3 (Upload Media) to step 4 (Invite Friends)?

Finally, you can decouple the time to convert metric from the time to convert breakdown based on a specific step in the funnel to understand which actions lead users to reach value faster.
- Do prospects purchase faster when their time to convert from viewing a product to adding it to cart is quick?
