You can now plot any funnel or retention metric in Insights, and you can plot any combination of them together. Insights is where you can see how any of your metrics are doing and how different metrics are doing side by side.

With these changes you can now:

- compare retention of different actions on the same retention curve chart
- see how the conversion rate for different steps in a funnel trend over time in the same chart
- see funnel and retention metrics in a table visualization of your board
- use table, pie, stacked bar and stacked line visualizations for funnel and retention metrics
- build a detailed table of funnel metrics in one space
- plot different types of metrics on the same line chart
- make formulas that use funnel and retention metrics
