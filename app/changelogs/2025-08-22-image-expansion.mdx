Expand images in Query Builder's context panel for a clearer view. When hovering over the event name, you can click associated images to easily view without leaving Query Builder.

Whether you're validating an event property or reviewing metadata details, expanded images give you the full picture without breaking your flow. No more switching tabs or guessing from a thumbnail.
