What if you could talk to your data using natural language? Now you can with Mixpanel MCP Server beta, democratizing analytics access across your entire organization.

### How It Works

The MCP Server serves as a bridge between AI tools (i.e., Claude) and your Mixpanel data. Connect your AI assistant and ask questions in plain English, such as "What's the retention rate for users who completed onboarding?" or "Show me our top converting events this quarter".
### Key Benefits
Chat with your data like your most helpful coworker. Improve time-to-insight from "let me build you a dashboard" to "here is your answer". Empower non-technical team members to ask data questions without requiring analytics support.

### Getting Started
Organization administrators enable MCP Server access in **Settings > Organization > Overview**. Then connect your AI tool and start asking questions in natural language. [Learn more in our documentation](/docs/features/mcp).
