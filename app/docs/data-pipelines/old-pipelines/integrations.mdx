# Data Pipeline Integrations

<Callout type="info">
  This page highlights integrations that send Mixpanel data to data warehouses.
  Learn more about [integrations that import data from other destinations into
  Mixpanel](/docs/tracking-methods/integrations) and [integrations that export
  cohorts for audience targeting](/docs/cohort-sync/integrations).
</Callout>

These integrations allow you to send your [raw data](/docs/data-pipelines#raw) and [schematized data](/docs/data-pipelines#schematized) to your cloud storage bucket or data warehouse. You may review our complete integrations directory [here](https://mixpanel.com/partners/integrations). If you don't see what you're looking for [reach out to us](https://mixpanel.com/get-support).
