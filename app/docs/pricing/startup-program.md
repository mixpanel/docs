# Startup Program: Use Mixpanel for free for the first year

The Mixpanel for Startups program empowers early-stage companies to easily track and analyze data to find product-market fit and more. The program is open to startups that meet the following requirements:

- Incorporated less than five years ago.
- Raised no more than $8 million (USD) in total funding.
- Haven't previously redeemed other Mixpanel offers.
- Haven’t been on a paid plan. 

Eligible startups receive their first year free on the Startup Plan, an exclusive offering for startup program participants. The Startup Plan allows you to take advantage of the full analytics capabilities of Mixpanel, without any feature limits. This includes access to all advanced reports such as [Signal](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/reports/apps/signal) and [Experiments](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/reports/apps/experiments), our add-on packages (Data Pipelines, Group Analytics, Warehouse Connectors), and Session Replays. The Startup Plan covers data volumes of up to 1 billion events per year. With the Startup Plan, unlock all the power of Mixpanel you'll need to launch, grow, and scale your product.

In order to maintain status in the program, participants must begin sending data to Mixpanel within 90 days of acceptance. If you are not ready to begin implementation, we encourage you to wait and apply once ready.

Participants will be invited to join our exclusive Mixpanel for Startups Community in Slack where you’ll have access to curated content, workshops, resources, and opportunities to learn from other startups as well as the team at Mixpanel.

### Startup Plan Details
#### What is included in the Startup Plan?
The Startup Plan is designed specifically for participants in the Mixpanel for Startups program. It includes all our advanced reports, as well as add-on packages (Data Pipelines, Group Analytics, Warehouse Connectors, and Session Replay). The Startup Plan is valid for 12 months, has an annual data limit of 1 billion events, and includes 500,000 Session Replay recordings. The Startup Plan is not eligible for BAAs or MSAs.

#### What is the implementation requirement?
Once accepted into the program, startups must start sending data to Mixpanel within the first 90 days to maintain eligibility. If a participating startup doesn’t meet the implementation requirement within the first 90 days, they’ll be removed from the program and prohibited from rejoining. This isn’t to deter startups from joining, but rather encourage them to only apply once truly ready so as to take full advantage of the program and maximize value from Mixpanel.

#### What happens if my usage exceeds 1B events?
If you send over 1B events to Mixpanel during the startup program, you’ll have the option to upgrade to a paid Growth or Enterprise plan, or downgrade to the Free plan. If you’re close to exceeding the limit of the Startup Plan, our team will reach out in advance to discuss your options.

#### Can I continue with the Startup Plan after the first year and receive a second year free?
No. The Mixpanel for Startups program offers eligible companies their first year of Mixpanel for free on the Startup Plan. After the first year, startups are able to move to a Free, Growth, or Enterprise plan. The Startup Plan is only available through the startup program, and cannot be purchased as a standalone plan. 

### Program FAQ
#### How does the startup program work?
Once accepted into the program, your Mixpanel account will be provisioned with the Startup Plan. This plan is valid for one year and the term will begin once your application is approved. In order to maintain your eligibility status in the program, startups must begin sending data to Mixpanel within 90 days of your acceptance. If you are not ready to begin implementation, we encourage you to wait and apply once ready. 

#### How do I apply?
Eligible startups can [apply here](https://mixpanel.com/startups-apply/)! If you were referred to the program through your VC or accelerator, please select the referral partner from the dropdown menu. Once you confirm your eligibility and submit the form, your account will automatically be provisioned with the Startup Plan and your free year in the program will begin.

#### What if my VC or accelerator is not listed in the application dropdown?
Not all of our partners are currently listed on the application. Please select “Other” from the dropdown menu and enter the name of your VC, accelerator, incubator, or other referral partner. If you were not referred, please select "I do not have a referral partner". 

#### Will I receive help getting started with Mixpanel? 
Yes! We’ll provide self-serve resources to help with your onboarding and provide access to our [Mixpanel Community](https://community.mixpanel.com/) where you’ll be able to engage with other users and our team. Our Support team is on hand to assist with technical questions as needed, too.

#### Can I apply now and save the offer for later?
No. Once you confirm your eligibility and enroll in the program, the offer through Mixpanel for Startups is activated. Your one free year on the Startup Plan begins at enrollment. Additionally, if you do not start sending data to Mixpanel within 90 days of joining, you will be removed from the program. If you are not ready for the startup program, you can sign up for a [Free plan](https://mixpanel.com/pricing/) and apply to the program when you’re ready to take advantage of the offer. Startups are in Mixpanel’s DNA — so we have a generous free plan (1M events per month) to help you get started.

#### What happens after my year in the startup program?
Once you complete your year in the startup program, our team will work with you and advise on the best Mixpanel plan based on your usage and growth plans. We can help determine whether a Free, Growth, or Enterprise plan will best suit your needs going forward.

#### Why is the startup program offer so generous?
Startups are a part of Mixpanel’s DNA! We are dedicated to having the best startup program on the market and supporting as many founders as we can. The Mixpanel for Startups program provides the first year free on our exclusive Startup Plan, which allows participants to utilize all our features and functionality. Startups should focus on building world-class products and not worry about short-term trials, restrictive data plans, and hidden pricing.

### Eligibility Criteria
#### What do you consider a startup?
To be eligible for the program and considered a startup, you cannot have raised more than $8 million USD and must have been founded less than 5 years ago. The Mixpanel for Startups program is not available for startups who are already a paid customer, have been on a paid plan in the past, or previously participated in the program. If you have questions about your eligibility status, please reach out to our team at [startups@mixpanel.com](mailto:startups@mixpanel.com).

#### Do I have to be new to Mixpanel to join the program?
No. As long as your startup has not redeemed another exclusive offer or has already been a paid customer, you are eligible to apply.

#### What offers prevent me from qualifying for the startup program?
If you have already redeemed an offer through the [Product School](https://productschool.teachable.com/p/productanalytics) or another partner, you are not eligible for the startup program. Startups are only able to participate in the Mixpanel for Startups program once. 

#### Do I need to be associated with a VC or accelerator to join?
No! As long as you meet the eligibility criteria, you’re welcome to join. When you submit the form, please select ‘I do not have a referral partner’ from the dropdown menu.

#### What happens if I misrepresent my eligibility status?
When you applied to participate in the Startup Program, you are asked to confirm that you meet the following eligibility criteria: 
1. Have not been on a paid Mixpanel plan; 
2. The entity you represent was founded less than 5 years ago (at the time of sign up);  
3. The entity you represent has not raised more than $8M in total funding (at the time of sign up).
If Mixpanel becomes aware that your entity may not meet one or more of the aforementioned eligibility criteria, Mixpanel may, at its sole discretion, work with you to transition the account to a paid account, suspend the account until additional information is provided to validate adherence to the eligibility criteria, or where sufficient evidence is present to indicate that your account does not meet the eligibility criteria, terminate your startup account, by providing written notice. 


### [Legacy] Credit-Based Program FAQ

If you are in the earlier version of the Mixpanel for Startups program which utilized “startup credits” and have specific questions regarding your account, please reach out to [startups@mixpanel.com](mailto:startups@mixpanel.com). 

#### What is the credit-based startup program?
Prior to September 2024, the Mixpanel for Startups program provided eligible startups with their first year of Mixpanel free, valued up to \$50,000. Startups in this program are able to purchase an annual Growth plan as well as Group Analytics and Data Pipelines add-on packages utilizing credits. 

After acceptance to the program, \$50,000 in credits were added to participants’ Mixpanel account and automatically applied to eligible line items when purchasing an annual [Growth plan](https://mixpanel.com/pricing/#edit-plan) via our plan-builder. The credits cover up to \$50,000 in total usage within the first year. Any additional usage costs in excess of \$50,000 are not covered by the program and will be charged to the credit card on file.

#### Is eligibility different for the credit-based startup program?
No. The startup program – be it the credit or Startup Plan version – have the same eligibility requirements ([outlined above](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/pricing/startup-program#eligibility-criteria)).

#### How do I know if I am in the credit-based startup program?
The credit-based startup program was valid prior to September 4, 2024. If you are currently in this version of the program, \$50,000 worth of credits were added to your account to apply to eligible purchases and upgrades made in your first year. You can see these credits in your Mixpanel account under Organization Settings > Plan Details & Billing.

The Manage Billing & Payment section displays detailed information about the credits that are used to cover your first year of Mixpanel. Eligible credits will also appear in the checkout process when purchasing a Growth plan and premium features through the online plan-builder.

#### Will the startup credits in my account expire?
Yes. The credit-based startup program provides your first year of Mixpanel for free, valued up to \$50,000. After one year, the unused credits expire and are no longer valid. You can see the expiration date in the Credits tab under Plan Details & Billing in the Organization Settings. Once the year elapses, the credits expire and the credit card on file will be charged to cover the subscription renewal and additional data costs.
