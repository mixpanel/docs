# What to Track

In this guide, we provide guidance on what to track and how to track it.

## Start With 2 Events

We recommend starting with just 2 events, which can provide a lot of value with little effort:

- **Sign Up** - Tracking Sign Up is a quick way to understand your product's growth; by counting the number
  of Sign Ups, you can answer "How many new users am I acquiring every day, week, and month?".

- **Value Moment** - Tracking a value moment can help you assess how well your product is doing. You can
  answer questions like "How many users experience value in my product each day/week/month?" or
  "How many users come back (retain) and experience the moment again?".

### Choose a Value Moment

Value moments are often the use of important features or taking a critical action. Here are some examples:

- **Social**: Post Created, Friend Added
- **E-Commerce**: Purchase Completed, Review Submitted
- **Media**: Video Watched, Article Read
- **SaaS**: Document Created, Call Started

We recommend keeping your event names short and descriptive. We like to use the Object-Action convention, as you can see
in the examples above.

### Include Properties

Properties add context to the event. We recommend these properties for your two events:

**Sign Up**

- **Source** (e.g Referral, Organic, Paid)
- **Country** (e.g. United States, Vietnam, Germany)
- **OS** (e.g. Windows, iOS, Android)

**Value Moment**

- Up to you! This will depend greatly on your value moment:
  - A "Video Watched" event may benefit from a "Duration" property
  - A "Message Liked" event may benefit from a "Message Type" property
- Ask yourself: What is the most important information related to your value moment?

## We Recommend Server-Side Tracking

Adblockers and browsers are making it harder and harder to track users on the client-side.
If you want to make sure the data you're collecting is accurate, you'll want to do most of
your tracking server-side.

**Frontend event tracking (especially on the web) loses between 15% and 30% of events**.
If you're only tracking on the client-side, you're missing out on a lot of data, even if you're
using a reverse proxy.

    Once you've chosen a few events to track first, you're ready to set up
    Mixpanel.
