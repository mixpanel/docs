This guide demonstrates how to set up a serverless ingest pipeline from an AWS S3 bucket into Mixpanel. Once this is set up, you can simply upload files containing events into the designated S3 bucket and the events will be ingested into Mixpanel, both one-time and on a recurring basis. Setup should take ~5-10 minutes.

}

[Create a dedicated S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html) for this integration. We recommend including `mixpanel-import` in the name to make it explicit and avoid any accidental data sharing.

You can create the bucket in any region, though it will need to be in the same region as your AWS Lambda function.

{
  "title": "Step 2a: Setup the Lambda Function"
}
[/block]
Create a [new Lambda Function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started-create-function.html). 
* Select `Author From Scratch`.
* Set the runtime to `python 3.7`.
* Select  `Create Function`.

Add a trigger so that your Lambda function runs whenever a new object is added to your bucket by selecting `Add trigger` under `Function Overview`. You will want to use the bucket created in Step 2 and select `All object create events`.

Click `Versions` > `Publish New Version` to deploy the function. At this point, any file you upload to the bucket will trigger an invocation of the function and an import into Mixpanel. Let's test it out!
[block:api-header]
{
  "title": "Step 3: Test with sample data and watch the logs"
}
[/block]
Let's test the connection with some [sample events](https://storage.googleapis.com/mixpanel-sample-data/10-events.json). Run the following to copy them to your bucket, which will trigger the import:

`gsutil cp cp gs://mixpanel-sample-data/10-events.json s3://your-s3-bucket/example.json`

Monitor the logs of your Lambda Function; you should see an `Import Complete` log line within a minute.

Finally, let's confirm that the events made it into Mixpanel. Head to the [Events](https://mixpanel.com/report/live) page, pick `test_event` in the event picker, and you should see the events you just imported.

}
[/block]
We're now ready for an import of your own data. If your data is not already in the Mixpanel format, this is a good time to write a transformation step to run as part of the Lambda. We recommend testing locally as you iterate on your data transformation logic, as it's much quicker than redeploying the Lambda. The [Overview](doc:cloud-ingestion) page has sample code and data to test locally.

Once you're ready and have tested with a few small files, you can upload all the files for your import to your S3 bucket, and the import will kick off. This pipeline can be made recurring by uploading files to the S3 bucket periodically.

We recommend partitioning files in S3 to ~200MB of JSON for optimal performance.
