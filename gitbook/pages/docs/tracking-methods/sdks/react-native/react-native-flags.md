# Implement Feature Flags (React Native)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Feature Flags for React Native is currently in **Beta**. Install the beta SDK version: `npm install mixpanel-react-native@beta` (minimum version `v3.2.0-beta.3`).
{% endhint %}

## Overview

This developer guide will assist you in configuring your React Native application for Feature Flags using the [Mixpanel React Native SDK](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/react-native). Feature Flags allow you to control the rollout of your features, conduct A/B testing, and manage application behavior without deploying new code.

Feature Flags in the React Native SDK work across iOS, Android, Expo, and React Native Web platforms.

For complete React Native SDK documentation, see the [React Native SDK guide](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/react-native).

## Prerequisites

Before implementing Feature Flags, ensure:

- You are on an Enterprise subscription plan and have the beta version of the SDK installed (minimum supported version is `v3.2.0-beta.3`). Install via: `npm install mixpanel-react-native@beta`
- You have your Project Token from your [Mixpanel Project Settings](/docs/orgs-and-projects/managing-projects#find-your-project-tokens)
- For iOS native apps, run `cd ios && pod install` after installing the beta SDK

{% hint style="info" %}
**Data Residency:** Use the server URL that matches your Mixpanel project's data residency region:
- **US** (default): `https://api.mixpanel.com`
- **EU**: `https://api-eu.mixpanel.com`
- **India**: `https://api-in.mixpanel.com`
{% endhint %}

## Execution Modes

The React Native SDK operates in two modes that affect how feature flags are evaluated:

| Mode | Platforms | How It Works |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Native** | iOS, Android | Bridges to the native Swift/Android SDKs for flag evaluation |
| **JavaScript** | Expo, React Native Web | Uses a pure JavaScript implementation (aligned with mixpanel-js) |

{% hint style="info" %}
Expo apps automatically use JavaScript mode since native modules are not available. You do not need to configure this manually.
{% endhint %}

The mode is determined by the `useNative` parameter in the `Mixpanel` constructor:

```javascript
import { Mixpanel } from 'mixpanel-react-native';

// Native mode (default for bare React Native apps)
const mixpanel = new Mixpanel("YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN");

// JavaScript mode (for Expo or React Native Web)
const mixpanel = new Mixpanel("YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN", false, false);
```

## Flag Initialization

Initializing the SDK with feature flags enabled requires passing `featureFlagsOptions` with `enabled: true` to the `init()` method. This enables making an outbound request to Mixpanel servers with the current user context.

The server will assign the user context to a variant for each feature flag according to how they are configured in the Mixpanel UX.

The response will include an assigned variant for each flag that the user context is in a rollout group for. If a flag is not returned, it most likely signifies that the user was excluded by filtering rules or the rollout percentage for the flag.

**Example Usage**

```javascript
import { Mixpanel } from 'mixpanel-react-native';

// For native apps (iOS/Android)
const mixpanel = new Mixpanel("YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN");

// For Expo / React Native Web, use JavaScript mode:
// const mixpanel = new Mixpanel("YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN", false, false);

await mixpanel.init(
  false,                       // optOutTrackingDefault
  {},                          // superProperties
  "https://api.mixpanel.com",  // serverURL (see Data Residency above)
  true,                        // useGzipCompression
  { enabled: true }            // featureFlagsOptions
);
```

If your flag is configured with a Variant Assignment Key other than `distinct_id` or `device_id` for any of the feature flags in your project, then the call to initialize feature flags must include those keys.

For example, for a Variant Assignment Key, `company_id`, you would setup the SDK as follows:

```javascript
await mixpanel.init(
  false,
  {},
  undefined,
  undefined,
  {
    enabled: true,
    context: {
      company_id: "X",
    },
  }
);
```

If you are using Runtime Targeting in any of the feature flags in your project, then any properties that you use in targeting should be included in a `custom_properties` node within the context:

```javascript
await mixpanel.init(
  false,
  {},
  undefined,
  undefined,
  {
    enabled: true,
    context: {
      company_id: "X",
      custom_properties: {
        platform: "react-native",
      },
    },
  }
);
```

## Flag Reload

Following initialization, you can reload feature flag assignments in several ways:

### Reload via identify

After a user logs in or out of your application and you call `identify`, a feature flag reload will be triggered.

```javascript
const updatedDistinctId = "user-123";
await mixpanel.identify(updatedDistinctId);
```

### Manual Reload

You can manually reload flags at any time:

```javascript
await mixpanel.flags.loadFlags();
```

### Update Context (JavaScript Mode Only)

{% hint style="warning" %}
The `updateContext` method is only available in **JavaScript mode** (Expo / React Native Web). In native mode, context must be set during initialization and calling `updateContext` will throw an error.
{% endhint %}

In JavaScript mode, you can update the feature flags context after initialization, which will trigger a reload with the new context values:

```javascript
await mixpanel.flags.updateContext({
  company_id: "Y",
  custom_properties: {
    platform: "mobile",
  },
});
```

By default, the new context is merged with the existing context. To replace the context entirely, pass `{ replace: true }`:

```javascript
await mixpanel.flags.updateContext(
  { company_id: "Z" },
  { replace: true }
);
```

## Flag Evaluation

The SDK provides both asynchronous (Promise-based) and synchronous methods for evaluating flags.

### Async Evaluation (Recommended)

Async methods return Promises that resolve once flags are ready. This is the recommended approach as it handles the case where flags may not yet be loaded.

**Experiment Flags: Get Variant Value**

```javascript
// Fetch the variant value once flags are ready and track an exposure event
// *if* the user context is in a rollout group for the feature flag.
const fallback = "control"; // used if the user doesn't match any rollout rules
const variantValue = await mixpanel.flags.getVariantValue("my-feature-flag", fallback);

if (variantValue === "variant_a") {
  showExperienceForVariantA();
} else if (variantValue === "variant_b") {
  showExperienceForVariantB();
} else {
  showDefaultExperience();
}
```

**Feature Gates: Check if Flag is Enabled/Disabled**

```javascript
const isEnabled = await mixpanel.flags.isEnabled("my-boolean-flag", false);

if (isEnabled) {
  showNewFeature();
} else {
  showOldFeature();
}
```

**Get Full Variant Object**

Use `getVariant` to retrieve the full variant object, which includes metadata like `experiment_id`:

```javascript
const variant = await mixpanel.flags.getVariant("my-feature-flag", {
  key: "control",
  value: "standard",
});

console.log(`Variant: ${variant.key}, Value: ${variant.value}`);
if (variant.experiment_id) {
  console.log(`Part of experiment: ${variant.experiment_id}`);
}
```

**Callback Pattern**

All async methods also support a callback-style API:

```javascript
mixpanel.flags.getVariantValue("my-feature-flag", "control", (value) => {
  console.log(`Variant value: ${value}`);
});

mixpanel.flags.isEnabled("my-boolean-flag", false, (isEnabled) => {
  if (isEnabled) {
    showNewFeature();
  }
});
```

### Sync Evaluation

Synchronous methods return values immediately without waiting. Use these when you need to evaluate flags in render paths or other synchronous contexts.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Sync methods return the fallback value if flags have not finished loading. Always check `areFlagsReady()` before relying on sync results.
{% endhint %}

```javascript
if (mixpanel.flags.areFlagsReady()) {
  const variantValue = mixpanel.flags.getVariantValueSync("my-feature-flag", "control");
  const isEnabled = mixpanel.flags.isEnabledSync("my-boolean-flag", false);

  // Full variant object
  const variant = mixpanel.flags.getVariantSync("my-feature-flag", {
    key: "control",
    value: "standard",
  });
}
```

## Exposure Events

Calling `isEnabled`, `isEnabledSync`, `getVariantValue`, `getVariantValueSync`, `getVariant`, or `getVariantSync` triggers tracking an exposure event, `$experiment_started` to your Mixpanel project *if* the user context is in a rollout group for the feature flag.

## Method Name Aliases

The React Native SDK supports both camelCase and snake_case method names, aligned with mixpanel-js conventions:

| camelCase | snake_case |
|-----------|------------|
| `areFlagsReady()` | `are_flags_ready()` |
| `getVariant()` | `get_variant()` |
| `getVariantSync()` | `get_variant_sync()` |
| `getVariantValue()` | `get_variant_value()` |
| `getVariantValueSync()` | `get_variant_value_sync()` |
| `isEnabled()` | `is_enabled()` |
| `isEnabledSync()` | `is_enabled_sync()` |
| `updateContext()` | `update_context()` |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if I'm not receiving any flags on SDK initialization?

1. **Check your project token**:
  - Ensure you're using the correct project token from your [Mixpanel project settings](/docs/orgs-and-projects/managing-projects#find-your-project-tokens)
2. **Review flag configuration**:
  - Make sure your feature flag is enabled
  - Check the flag's rollout percentage
- User contexts that are not assigned to the rollout percentage will not receive flags
  - If you are using a targeting cohort, verify on the mixpanel 'Users' page that the user's `distinct_id` is a member of that cohort.

3. **Review SDK parameters**:
  - Ensure `featureFlagsOptions` with `enabled: true` is passed to `init()`
  - If using a custom Variant Assignment Key, ensure it is included in the `context` object
  - If using Runtime Targeting, ensure all properties used in targeting are included in the `custom_properties` object within `context`

4. **Confirm beta SDK version**: Feature flags require the beta version (`npm install mixpanel-react-native@beta`, minimum `v3.2.0-beta.3`)
5. **Check flags readiness**: Use `areFlagsReady()` to check if flags have been loaded before using sync evaluation methods
6. **Enable debug logging**: Call `mixpanel.setLoggingEnabled(true)` to see detailed information about flag requests and responses

### Why is `updateContext` throwing an error?

`updateContext` is only supported in **JavaScript mode** (Expo / React Native Web). If you are using native mode (bare React Native on iOS/Android), you must set the context during initialization via `featureFlagsOptions`. There is no way to update context after init in native mode.

### Which mode should I use?

- **Bare React Native apps** (iOS/Android): Use **native mode** (`new Mixpanel(token)`) for best performance, as it delegates to the optimized native SDKs.
- **Expo apps**: Use **JavaScript mode** (`new Mixpanel(token, false, false)`), which is the automatic default in Expo since native modules are not available.
- **React Native Web**: Use **JavaScript mode**.
