OptionalRequestParameter:
  UseIpAsDistinctId:

    required: false

    description: >-
      If present and equal to 1, Mixpanel will use the ip address
      of the incoming request and compute a distinct_id using a hash
      function if no distinct_id is provided. This is different from
      providing a `properties.ip` value in the Event Object.

              If present and equal to 1, Mixpanel will validate the provided records and return a JSON object with per-record error messages for records that fail validation.
  ResponseType:
    Verbose:
      in: query

      description: >-
        If present and equal to 1, Mixpanel will respond with a JSON
        Object describing the success or failure of the tracking
        call. The returned object will have two keys: `status`,
        with the value 1 on success and 0 on failure, and `error`,
        with a string-valued error message if the request wasn't
        successful. This is useful for debugging during
        implementation.
    PNGPixel:
      in: query

      description: >-
        If present and equal to 1, Mixpanel will serve a 1x1
        transparent pixel image as a response to the request. This
        is useful for adding [Pixel Tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_beacon)
        in places that javascript is not supported.
    JavascriptWithCallback:
      in: query
      name: callback
      required: false
      schema:
          type: string
      description: >-
        If present, Mixpanel will return a `content-type: text/javascript`
        with a body that calls a function by value provided. This is useful
        for creating local callbacks to a successful track call in JavaScript.
