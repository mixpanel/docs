Event deduplication allows a project to send the same exact event while only recording that event once.
Deduplication only occurs when a subset of the event data is exactly identical.

In other words, each event containing an $insert_id is checked for duplication after being minimized to the following shape:

```json
{
  "event": "Back to Back",
  "properties": {
    "token": "project_token",
    "distinct_id": "aubrey@thesix.views",
    "time": 1601412131000,
    "$insert_id": "88B7hahbaschhhB66cbsg"
  },
}
```

If this simplified object is an exact match to any other simplified event it is marked as a duplicate. Ingested events that have been marked as a duplicate will be deleted within 24 hours.

If an event is sent to the Ingestion API without an `$insert_id` one will be generated for it. However, it will not qualify for the deduplication process.
