                    This parameter can drastically reduce the amount of data
                    returned by the API when you're not interested in all
                    properties and can speed up queries significantly.

                    A string id provided in the results of a previous query.
                    Using a session_id speeds up api response, and allows paging
                    through results.
                page:
                  type: integer

                    Which page of the results to retrieve. Pages start at zero.
                    If the "page" parameter is provided and above 0, the session_id
                    parameter must also be provided.

                  description: >-
                    If you are exporting user profiles using an event selector,
                    you use a `behaviors` parameter in your request. `behaviors`
                    and `filter_by_cohort` are mutually exclusive.

                    `behaviors` parameter and you don't included the parameter
                    `as_of_timestamp`, you'll see the following error:
