The “aha” moment in your product describes the actions a new user does after signup that lead them to become an active user of your product. 
A classic example is Facebook’s “aha moment”, which was “adding 10 friends within 7 days results in a huge jump in daily active usage”. 

Finding your "aha" moment requires an understanding of how user behaviors impact long term retention, and now, we've made that analysis possible through Behavioral Properties in Retention.

As an example, you can dig into what actions a user does withn 7 days after signup that lead them to watch more videos long term.
The result we find is that the more channels they subscribe to, the more likely they are to retain. This insight can drive a strategy to create an experience that prompts users to subscribe to popular channels when they first signup.
