# Overview

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4415151340564/Screen_Shot_2022-01-07_at_2.07.26_PM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4415151340564/Screen_Shot_2022-01-07_at_2.07.26_PM.png)

Mixpanel Boards allow you to view all your most important metrics at a glance. Add Insights, Flows, Funnels, and Retention reports to a board to be able to track those metrics both regularly and simultaneously.

# Use Cases

Boards can be used to keep your whole company on top of your KPIs. Additionally, you can add text to your boards to help tell a compelling story, or highlight specific interpretations of the other reports on boards.

Create personal boards or project boards and share them with your team to help you and your colleagues understand and stay on top of your metrics.

# Quick Start

## Step 1: Navigating Boards

Before creating a board of your own, it's best to explore existing boards within your Mixpanel project. There's a good chance that someone has already created a board that may be of interest to you. The best way to navigate to existing boards within your Mixpanel project is the directory on the lefthand side of the page. This directory makes it easy to access your most-used boards by organizing them into several sections:

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/11441973595156](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/11441973595156)

**Favorites**: to favorite a board, click the "Favorite" button at the top right of that board. Once you've done so, it will appear in the favorites section at the top left of the board's page.

**Pinned**: pinned boards are important boards for your organization. Mixpanel users with the [Admin or Owner roles](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024613412-Project-Roles-and-Permissions-) will be able to pin a board such that it appears in the Pinned section for every project member.

**Your Boards**: any boards you create will appear in this section. To create a new board, click "+ New Board" at the top of the directory.

Finally, you can search for all boards, or recently viewed boards, at the top of the directory.

## Step 2: Creating a new Board

Once you've decided that you want to create a board of your own, on the Boards page, click "+ New Board" at the top of the left side directory. The new untitled board will be created immediately, but you may wish to give it a name. To do so, click the current title, then type the desired name. At this point, your empty board will look like this:

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/11442046149268](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/11442046149268)

## Step 3: Adding content to Boards

There are 3 types of content that you can add to a board:

1. An existing report that has already been created
2. A new report that you can make from Insights, Funnels, Flows or Retention
3. A text card to give context to your board

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/11442000560788](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/11442000560788)

There are a few ways to add an existing report to a board. You can either start on a board, and add reports to it directly, or start from a report and choose the boards to which the report should be added.

- Starting from a board, adding a report can be done via the "Add" button near the top right of the board, or if the board is empty, from the center of the page. This will open a popup from which you can choose to create a new report of any type or add an existing report.
- Starting from an existing report, adding the report to a board can be done via the board breadcrumb dropdown at the top left of the report, next to the report's title. Click into the dropdown, then select "Add to another Board." Choose your board, and a copy of the report will be added to it.
- Starting from another board, select the overflow menu of a report you'd like to add. Select "Make a Copy" and then choose the board you would like to add it to.

Note that adding an existing report always creates a [linked copy](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409841288724-Dashboards-FAQ#what-is-a-linked-report).

## Step 4: Arrange Board Content

### A Row-Based System

Content is arranged within rows. To add a card (either a report or text) to a row, click the "+" button that appears on the left of a row when you hover over that row.

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/7412576771860/Screen_Shot_2022-06-29_at_11.49.22_AM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/7412576771860/Screen_Shot_2022-06-29_at_11.49.22_AM.png)

To add a row, click the "+ Add Row" button below the last existing row in the board.

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/7412579405716/Screen_Shot_2022-06-29_at_11.49.58_AM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/7412579405716/Screen_Shot_2022-06-29_at_11.49.58_AM.png)

### Moving Cards

To change the order of reports, simply click and drag any report to your desired position, via the gripper icon at the top right of the report.

### Resizing Cards

Cards on a row will automatically expand to fill the width of that row, but once two or more cards are on the row, you can adjust each card's width by clicking and dragging the control between any two cards. Hover between the cards to surface the drag control.

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/7412575948948/Screen_Shot_2022-06-29_at_11.50.42_AM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/7412575948948/Screen_Shot_2022-06-29_at_11.50.42_AM.png)

Up to four cards (either reports or text) can exist within a row, and the content in a row will automatically expand to fill the horizontal width of that row. Cards can be horizontally resized within a row, and will snap to positions 1/12th of the width of the row - the minimum width of a card is 3/12th, or one quarter of the width of the row. This makes it easy to fill a row with 1, 2, 3, or 4 cards of equal size.

### Resizing Rows

Row heights can now be adjusted to either show more report content, or hide empty space. To vertically resize a row, click and drag the control under that row. Hover under the row to surface the control.

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/7412629381908/Screen_Shot_2022-06-29_at_11.51.48_AM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/7412629381908/Screen_Shot_2022-06-29_at_11.51.48_AM.png)

A row's height is initially determined by the tallest card within that row. Text cards can be very short if they contain only one line of text, or very tall if they contain many lines. Meanwhile, reports always start at their minimum height, but may warrant expansion in order to show more data (more bars on a bar chart, for example).

A row will start life at the minimum possible height

## Board Templates

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/6738945528084/2022-06-01_12.31.38.gif](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/6738945528084/2022-06-01_12.31.38.gif)

Creating a new board using the template.

The Company KPIs Board template allows users to generate a comprehensive board containing key metrics that are applicable to most products—engagement, retention, and growth. Using only two [events](https://developer.mixpanel.com/docs/plan-your-implementation#what-to-track), the template produces nine unique reports that can be further explored, segmented, and customized.

To get started, click the icon in the lefthand navigator to create a new board, and select `Use a Template`. Alternatively, the `Add` button will allow you to create a custom board from scratch.

### Adding Your Events

The template uses two events: “Sign Up” and “Value Moment.”

- [Sign Up](https://developer.mixpanel.com/docs/plan-your-implementation#sign-up-event): This is the event where a new user—free or paid—is acquired by creating a new account.
- [Value Moment](https://developer.mixpanel.com/docs/plan-your-implementation#value-moment-event): This is the event that indicates that a user is experiencing value in your product. For a social media platform, it could be creating a post; for a streaming service, it's watching a video; for e-commerce, it might be completing a purchase.

For projects that have already been implemented and have data, you will select your two corresponding events, at which point the `Apply` CTA will be enabled, and your board will be generated.

For projects that do not have data, please refer to our [dev docs](https://developer.mixpanel.com/docs/plan-your-implementation) and [implementation](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/categories/115001197206-Data-and-Implementation) resources.

### What’s in the Template?

The board contains 9 reports, organized thematically by Engagement, Retention, and Growth.

### Engagement

User engagement measures how users find value in a product or service. Engagement can be measured by a variety of activities such as clicks, shares, and more. Highly engaged users are more likely to lead to higher user growth because they are more likely to share the product or service with their network. These four reports track:

- How many users are finding value in your product
- Who are your most engaged users
- What is your product’s activation rate
- What happens to users who don’t reach your product’s value moment

### Retention

Retention is the metric that shows whether your product has staying power. Retention measures how many people are coming back, which is also a key indicator that users are realizing value in your product. These two reports track:

- How many engaged users come back
- Who are your dormant users

### Growth

Growth is about finding people who need your product and showing them that your product can bring value to them. These three reports track:

- How many new users are signing up
- Which channels are generating the most signups
- What is your DAU (Daily Active Users) and WAU (Weekly Active Users)

Together, these 9 reports create a holistic overview of a product’s most important metrics and are applicable across industries and stages of growth. Notably, for startups, this board will be a vital asset for finding product-market fit as well as for sharing with investors during and post-fundraising.

### Free Plan Experience

While the current [free plan](http://mixpanel.com/pricing) has a limit of 5 saved reports per user, the reports in the Company KPIs Board template do not count towards this limit until you modify and save them individually. The unmodified template includes a small `Mixpanel Template` tag at the top of the template board and template reports respectively to denote that they do not count towards the saved report limit.

**Takeaways**:

- **You only need two events** to use the template (Sign Up & Value Moment)
- In just a few clicks Mixpanel’s Company KPIs Board template generates 9 reports, covering **key KPIs for Engagement, Retention, and Growth**
- If you are a free plan user, the reports in the template don’t count towards your limit until you modify and save them as described above, but clicking and dragging the control under the row will resize it to any height above that minimum.

### Board-wide Date Ranges and Filters

Boards allow you to alter some aspects of the queries within each of the reports on that board, making it simple to ensure every report is showing results from a consistent set of data.  Both date ranges and filters can be added by clicking "Add Filter" at the top right of the board.  This will open a row, shown below, where the date range can be selected, and filters can be applied.

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4415151836820/Screen_Shot_2022-01-07_at_2.35.49_PM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4415151836820/Screen_Shot_2022-01-07_at_2.35.49_PM.png)

By default, date ranges and filters are temporary, allowing you to explore the data without overwriting the board. But, if you wish to save the date range and filter selections you've made to the board, so they'll appear for other users as well, click "Save to Board."

**Note**
Applying date ranges and filters on a board does not change the queries saved in each individual report; instead, it only changes the data displayed when you view those reports in the current board. If you click into a report from the board, however, Mixpanel will maintain the date range and filters to ensure you see data consistent between the board and report. Navigate to the report on its own, though, and you'll see the report's original saved date range and filters.

## Public Boards

With Public Boards you can now share your favorite Mixpanel metrics across your entire organization — regardless of whether your teammates have a Mixpanel login or not. Show stakeholders your latest insights with the click of a button, collaborate cross-functionally in new, heightened ways, and make better product decisions, faster, with everyone's buy-in.

Want to flex your data outside of your org? No problem. Share it with investors, agencies, customers, or post it on Twitter for all to see. Best of all, with optional password protection, your boards are only as public as you want them to be.

### Enabling/Disabling For Your Project

Public Boards is **disabled** by default, meaning no one can make a board public without first enabling the feature in [Project Settings](https://mixpanel.com/settings/project). Only Project Owners can enable/disable this feature.

Navigate to the Public Boards tab to enable Public Boards for the project:

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4404258643988/public_db_settings_view.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4404258643988/public_db_settings_view.png)

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4404258664980/Screen_Shot_2021-07-27_at_10.48.08_AM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4404258664980/Screen_Shot_2021-07-27_at_10.48.08_AM.png)

To disable, just click the "Disable for Project" button. It will turn off ALL currently publicly shared boards and will disallow the creation of any new ones.

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402033115540/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_2.50.01_PM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402033115540/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_2.50.01_PM.png)

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402033131540/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_2.51.08_PM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402033131540/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_2.51.08_PM.png)

### Creating a Public Link

If the Public Boards feature is enabled for your project, then you can create a Public Link from the Share Modal on the Boards page.

All project users, except project consumers, with edit access to the board can make the board public.

**Important Note:** Public Board Links are created with the context of the Data View in which the link is generated. Make sure to check the Data View you are currently in to ensure it is the one you want to share publicly.

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402039647764/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_2.54.06_PM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402039647764/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_2.54.06_PM.png)

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402033264660/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_2.57.00_PM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402033264660/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_2.57.00_PM.png)

**Free Plans:** As Free plans do not have full access to the Sharing Modal, it will look slightly different than that on Paid plans. To make a board public, also click the Share button and switch the "Make Public" toggle on (purple).

### Management of Public Board Links

To get a view of all current Public Boards links, go to the Public Boards section in [Project Settings](https://mixpanel.com/settings/project). You'll see a list of all boards shared publicly, the Data View to which each Public Link is associated, creator and creation time of the Public Link, and the Public Link URL. You can disable the individual Public Links from this view. You can also disable Public Links at once by turning off the Public Boards feature for the project (see Enabling/Disabling For Your Project).

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402033351956/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_2.59.53_PM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402033351956/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_2.59.53_PM.png)

### Password Protection

For additional security, create a password that will be required for anyone viewing your public board.

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402039864724/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_3.08.09_PM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402039864724/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_3.08.09_PM.png)

Go to the Share Modal > Public Board Details to manage the Public Board's password:

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402033857300/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_3.06.54_PM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402033857300/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_3.06.54_PM.png)

Check "Require Passcode" to enable password protection for the specific Public Link. The password will be shown only upon creation. If you forget passcode, you will need to provide a new password.

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402039899796/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_3.07.27_PM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402039899796/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_3.07.27_PM.png)

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402033944212/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_3.08.45_PM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402033944212/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_3.08.45_PM.png)

Use the copy button next to the public URL if you want require passcode. Use the Embed Link button to copy the public URL with the passcode embedded.

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402034004500/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_3.09.17_PM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402034004500/Screen_Shot_2021-06-09_at_3.09.17_PM.png)

### Embedding Public Boards

Public Boards are embeddable in an iFrame, so you can add them to your docs (Notion, Coda, Confluence, etc.).

If you are requiring a passcode for the Shared Link, please use the Embed Link.

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402003037460/Screenshot_Capture_-_2021-05-06_-_13-31-57.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402003037460/Screenshot_Capture_-_2021-05-06_-_13-31-57.png)

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402022716308/Screenshot_Capture_-_2021-05-06_-_13-31-32.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402022716308/Screenshot_Capture_-_2021-05-06_-_13-31-32.png)

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402022728468/embed.gif](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4402022728468/embed.gif)

## Formatting Text on Boards

Highlighting text you've added will pop up a menu where you can apply the following styling options:

- Font size (title, subtitle, text)
- List type (bullets or ordered)
- Bold, Highlight, Italic, Strikethrough, Underline
- Quote block
- Hyperlinks
- Dividers

Note that some options (ordered lists, quote blocks, underline, and dividers) are available in the "three dots" overflow menu on the right-hand side of the formatting popup.

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/7715246949268/Screen_Shot_2022-06-15_at_3.32.32_PM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/7715246949268/Screen_Shot_2022-06-15_at_3.32.32_PM.png)

## Adding Media Cards to Boards

To further add context to reports on boards, you can add media cards.

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/8636071037716/Screen_Shot_2022-08-17_at_10.56.02_AM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/8636071037716/Screen_Shot_2022-08-17_at_10.56.02_AM.png)

Media cards support local images and embedded videos. Media cards are able to be resized horizontally or vertically, similar to Report cards.

For images, the supported upload file types are PNG, JPG and GIF. GIFs will loop automatically. The upload limit is 5MB. For videos, the supported embedded video links are Vimeo, YouTube and Loom. In order for your team to be able to see uploaded videos, ensure that video settings are not set to private. See the following articles to understand video privacy settings:

- [Vimeo's Video Privacy Explain](https://vimeo.com/blog/post/video-privacy-explained/)
- [Share videos with unlisted links with Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/blog/post/share-unlisted-videos-with-private-links/)
- [Change video privacy settings on YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?hl=en)
- [How to use Loom's privacy settings](https://support.loom.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016527597-How-to-use-Loom-s-privacy-settings)

## Board Digests

Board Digests are a snapshot of a board sent as an email or a slack message. Digests allow members to share recent data with both project members and external audiences, providing quick and meaningful insight into a Mixpanel project.

You must be a Project Owner, Admin, or Analyst to create digests.

Digests can be sent once or sent repeatedly, presenting the option to send pertinent information once or to send data updates on a recurring basis. They can easily be built and managed as part of a Mixpanel Board report. Note that digests only show the 8 reports that are on the top of a board.

To create a Board Digest:

1. Select **Digests** from the overflow menu at the top right of the board.

    [https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/14250933536404](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/14250933536404)

2. The Digest Settings Control Center will display all active Digests. To create a new Digest, click **+ Create Digest** in the top right corner.
3. Fill out the resulting form, including the name of the digest, the board upon which the digest is based (note: the digest will only contain the first 8 reports in the board due to email size limitations), the intended email recipients or Slack channel, and the sending frequency (one time ASAP, daily, weekly, or monthly).
    - Any email address will receive the digest, whether or not they are internal or external to your organization
    - Private Slack Channels are not available, at this time.
4. Click 'Send'.

## Digests for Private Boards

It is possible to share a digest for a private board. However, there are some restrictions to what will be visible or accessible.

1. If you convert a regular board with digests into a private board, existing digests will still work with existing recipients. However, if they click **View Board**, they will not be able to access your private board. Creating new digests or editing existing digests within the private board will force you to limit recipients to yourself.
2. You cannot edit digests of someone else’s private board without selecting a different board that you have access to (regardless of your permissions or role). You can still delete the digest or select a different board.
3. You cannot see the title of someone else’s private board in a digest. The private board will appear as “Unknown Private Board”.

## Sharing

Sharing and permissions are set at the board level, and all reports saved on a board inherit the same set of sharing and permissions settings of that board.

To share a board, and therefore all reports contained within it, click the Share button at the top right of the board. From here, sharing works as before, but remember, sharing a board now shares all of that board's reports as well. [Click here](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044299311) to learn more about sharing.

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4409967447444/GIF3__light_.gif](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4409967447444/GIF3__light_.gif)

Both reports and boards can also be shared via the "Copy URL" button at the top right. Clicking this button will immediately copy the short link to the report or board, so you can quickly paste it into your application of choice.

![https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4409975253396/Screen_Shot_2021-11-08_at_11.01.00_AM.png](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/article_attachments/4409975253396/Screen_Shot_2021-11-08_at_11.01.00_AM.png)

So long as the recipient has access to the project, they will be able to see the shared report or board. However, unless they have specifically given Editor permissions, they will only be able to view it, not edit it.

## Permissions

Sharing and permissions are set at the board level, and all reports saved on a board inherit the same set of sharing and permissions settings of that board.

In the sharing process, you can choose the permissions level granted to the individual with whom you're sharing the board. Teammates with access to a board can either be Viewers (any changes made will not be saved) or Editors (changes made will be saved). [Click here](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044299311#permissions) to learn more about permissions.

As with sharing, setting a user's permission level on a board will give them the same permission level for all reports on that board.

# FAQ

## Where are reports saved to?

Reports are always saved to boards. Previously, reports were separately saved and added to boards. In boards now, when you save a report, you'll be prompted to save it to a specific board. In essence, the board now acts as a folder, with many potential purposes, including:

- A centralized place to track numerous metrics related to a product launch
- A chain of analyses digging into a particular behaviour or issue
- A set of draft reports you're working on

This will make it easy to keep reports organized, and reduce time wasted recreating the same reports again and again.

Note: This change only applies to the reports that can be added to boards—Mixpanel's core reports: Insights, Flows, Funnels, and Retention. Advanced reports like Signal, Experiments, and Impact have been moved to the Applications folder at the top right of the page.

## Where are sharing and permissions set?

Previously, sharing and permissions were editable at both the report and board levels. This made managing sharing and permissions tedious due to the sheer number of items requiring individual settings.

Now, all reports saved on the same board will have the same sharing and permissions settings. This means sharing multiple reports with your team is a simple matter of sharing the board. As before, however, any report or board can be shared by simply clicking the "Copy URL" button, and sharing the resulting short link.

## What happens to reports on multiple boards?

All copies of reports have a source location. This can be seen when looking at the report details.

However, the same report can be viewed from multiple different boards.

On boards, the arrow icon on the top left indicates of the report lives on this board, or is a linked view.

## What is a linked report?

Every report in Mixpanel has a board where it was originally saved to. This is called the original board. However, in the interest of being able to use the same report across a variety of boards and sharing the same insight across your team and company, Mixpanel has introduced the concept of a "linked report". A linked report is denoted by the arrow in the icon of the report. Any time an existing report is added to a board or a copy is made, a linked report is made. Any changes to the report will get reflected in all of the linked reports associated with the report.
