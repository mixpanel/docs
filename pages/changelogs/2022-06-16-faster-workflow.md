Undo mistakes, shift query blocks and switch reports with lightning speed. Now, Mixpanel workflows are even faster with tools to quickly build, rebuild, and explore your reports.

**Undo / Redo**
Weâ€™ve added shortcuts to make iterating between changes in your analysis blazingly fast. Cmd + Z to undo; Cmd + Shift + Z to redo. Change filters, date ranges, line vs bar chart, and go back in one second to compare before and after, or fix the view. Speed is the only constant.

**Drag & Drop Query Blocks**

Save valuable time by dragging and dropping an existing query block into a different section. Want to change your breakdown by cities into a filter by those same cities? Click and drag your query block from the breakdown section, place it into the filter section, and voila - no need to recreate your queries, simply drag and drop existing ones.

**Fluid Report Transitions**

Realized you can find the answer to your question in a different report? No worries - Fluid Report Transitions preserves the parameters of your original question for quick, stress-free report switching. Start in Insights and switch into Funnels, then into Flows, and back to Insights all while keeping the events, filters, breakdowns and date ranges you set originally - zero rebuilding required.
