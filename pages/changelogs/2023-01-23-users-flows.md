Back in March of 2022, we upgraded Mixpanel’s user insights analysis with View Users - a simple way to discover who’s contributing to a point on a chart or metric. Since then, Mixpanelers have leveraged this feature to learn more about their users who are driving product growth or stagnation.

With so many people enjoying the power of View Users, we’re excited to bring this functionality to additional areas of Mixpanel:

- **Flows report**
- **Trends Chart** in Funnels, Retention, and Retention Frequency report
- **Frequency Chart** in Funnels report
- **Top Paths Chart** in Funnels report
- **Time To Convert Chart** in Funnels report
- **Metric Chart** in Insights and Funnels report
- **Pie Chart** in Insights report
