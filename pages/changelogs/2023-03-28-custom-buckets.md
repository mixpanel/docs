Introducing **Custom Buckets**, a super simple way to group existing breakdowns to form meaningful segments. This added power can help you explore new, complex questions about your product usage by slicing & dicing like never before - all on the fly in an easy-to-use interface. Here are a few types of analysis you can build with Custom Buckets:

**Age Cohorts:** Group an age breakdown to determine how a new feature has affected a key usage metric for different generations (Gen Z = ages 18-26, Millennial = ages 27-41) since last month.
