We’ve revamped Custom Alerts to make it easier for you to notify your team when a metric significantly changes.

With just one click, you can set up Slack or email alerts for:

- When an important metric reaches a target, such as if "sign-ups" in "Japan" reaches 1000
- Monitoring unexpected behavior (or potentially faulty data), such as when any event in any segment changes by more than 25%

As a bonus, we’ve also improved admin controls so that you can better organize your workspace through bulk deletion and clearer invalid alert symbols.
