We’ve revamped Custom Alerts to make it easier for you to notify your team when a metric significantly changes.

<div style={{position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '64.90384615384616%', height: 0}}><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/2feb00896e90458e8d085495a2e62f14" frameBorder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowFullScreen style={{position: 'absolute', 'top': 0, 'left': 0, 'width': '100%', 'height': '100%'}}></iframe></div>

With just one click, you can set up Slack or email alerts for:

- When an important metric reaches a target, such as if "sign-ups" in "Japan" reaches 1000
- Monitoring unexpected behavior (or potentially faulty data), such as when any event in any segment changes by more than 25%

As a bonus, we’ve also improved admin controls so that you can better organize your workspace through bulk deletion and clearer invalid alert symbols.
