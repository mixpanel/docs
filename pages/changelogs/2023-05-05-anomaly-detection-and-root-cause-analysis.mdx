Introducing Anomaly Detection and Root Cause Analysis, two new features to help you save time staying on top of metrics and getting ahead of potential issues in your product, data, or company.

In addition to [Custom Alerts](https://help.mixpanel.com/docs/features/alerts) where you can manually set a threshold for alerting, you can now use Anomaly Detection to be automatically alerted in Slack or email when your data falls outside an expected range. We use a robust open-source tool [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) to forecast your time series data and determine whether the data point falls outside of your selected confidence interval.

With any fired alert, you can create a Root Cause Analysis in one click that will automatically generate a Board with 12 reports broken down by popular properties of the event. This Board helps you quickly investigate potential causes of the metric change, and each alert is tethered to one Root Cause Analysis so you aren’t duplicating work if you see that others already diagnosed the issue.

Ways you can catch and diagnose regressions faster with Mixpanel:
- Alerted in #marketing Slack channel of a major drop in traffic for a key content landing page. From the Root Cause Analysis, see from last touch breakdown that there’s an issue in a paid ad campaign no longer driving traffic.
- Alerted via email of a major drop in your team’s recent feature launch engagement. From the Root Cause Analysis, see from browser breakdown that there’s a severe dropoff for Safari due to a new bug.
- Alerted in #engineering Slack channel of a major drop in DAU. From the Root Cause Analysis, see that the drop is driven by users in APAC, coinciding with holiday of Lunar New Year.

With Anomaly Detection and Root Cause Analysis, you can stay on top of metrics and get your team moving quickly to a solution, without all the manual labor.
