Actions speak louder than demographics, especially when it comes to finding what behaviors lead users to key outcomes. 

That’s why we built Behavioral Breakdowns — a new way to segment users by what they do, not just who they are. Now, you have the ability to measure the correlation between a user's actions and their level of engagement, monetization, or other essential metrics.

Here are a few examples of how you can leverage Behavioral Breakdowns to inform your approach in getting users to perform a key action:
- When trying to get users to follow more accounts, you see that users who comment on 5 pieces of content within a week have a higher rate of following others. So, you make the comment button more accessible to decrease the friction it takes to comment.
- To get more users signed up for your credit card, you target your emails to users that spend, on average, over $100 every time they shop on your eCommerce store because that segment is more likely to apply for a credit card.
