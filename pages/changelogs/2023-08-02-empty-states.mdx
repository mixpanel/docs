We're excited to announce that we have released a new design for Boards without data. Now when a report can't populate, it will display one of two states: a faded out sample report or a "no data" status. 

![changelog Image](/changelog/empty-states-screenshot.png)

- Charts that show "no data" occur when an event has been tracked in the last 30 days, but a selected filter or date range result in no data for the report.
- If the report is configured with an event that hasn't been tracked in past 30 days or has never existed, the faded sample report will appear.

For example: you are an ecommerce company with a new Start Subscription event and you'd like to make a report to track subscriptions over time. 

- If you set up a report before this event starts being tracked, the report you create will show a faded out sample report like above.
- As data starts flowing, the report will populate as expected. 
- If you set the date range on the report to a day where no one signed up for a subscription, the report will show "no data" because there were no subscription events tracked that day.

This change is designed to make the experiences of creating a new Board and moving a Board to a new project easier to navigate and understand. Nothing needs to be done to experience this new state - it is live for all users on all plans.
