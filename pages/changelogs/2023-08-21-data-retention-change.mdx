We have updated our data retention policy to be based on event time, which is the timestamp corresponding to when the end user completed the event. The main impact for customers is that data outside of the retention window (5 years by default) based on event time will be permanently deleted. While this policy update does not affect the data retention window, you can contact our support team if you’d like to change this window.
