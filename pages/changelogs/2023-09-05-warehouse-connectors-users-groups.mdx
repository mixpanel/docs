You can now use Warehouse Connectors to import User and Group tables from your warehouse. With this capability, you can extend source-of-truth data about users and groups into Mixpanel for analysis. 

This importer leverages the same modal as the event importer so that there is one cohesive experience for event, user, and group data. We support importing user and group tables where properties are stored as columns. For more information, check out our [docs](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking/data-warehouse).
