Now when creating a new project, you will be prompted to view your automatically generated 🌱Starter Board. You’ll be greeted by empty reports, but they won’t stay that way for long.

This means that once data is flowing, you can get things going by answering key questions about your active users in seconds.

Starter Board is available for all organizations on all plans. To see Starter Board in action, you can check out this [loom overview](https://www.loom.com/share/677846ecfe094d74bb174dcca43baa2c?sid=fefa476e-ea56-4a5e-ab04-159071d351bb).
