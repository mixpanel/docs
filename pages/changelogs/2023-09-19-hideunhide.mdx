It’s now possible to hide or unhide events from your visualization so you can focus on the metrics that matter.

For example, when you have two events and one formula, your formula metric might be difficult to analyze since it’s a significantly smaller number than the other events. By hiding the other events, your visualization can scale appropriately to view the formula properly.
