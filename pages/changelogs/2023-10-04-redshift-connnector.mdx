Today, all customers can leverage Warehouse Connectors to import data via Redshift, in addition to Snowflake and BigQuery. You can set up recurring syncs from Redshift and ensure that Mixpanel is always in sync with your trusted data. You can import event, User, and Group profile data. 

Navigate to Project Settings > Warehouse Sources to get started today. For more information, check out our [docs](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking/data-warehouse/redshift) on setting up Redshift.
