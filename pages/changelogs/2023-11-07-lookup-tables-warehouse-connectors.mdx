Today, all customers can use Warehouse Connectors to import Lookup Tables from their warehouse. For a list of supported warehouses, check out this [list](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-methods/data-warehouse/overview). This capability allows you to periodically enrich Mixpanel with data from your source-of-truth. 

For more information, check out our [docs](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-methods/data-warehouse/sending-lookup-table).
