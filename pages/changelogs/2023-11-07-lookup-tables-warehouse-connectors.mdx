Today, all customers can use Warehouse Connectors to import Lookup Tables from their warehouse. For a list of supported warehouses, check out this [list](/docs/tracking-methods/data-warehouse). This capability allows you to periodically enrich Mixpanel with data from your source-of-truth. 

For more information, check out our [docs](/docs/tracking-methods/data-warehouse#lookup-tables).
