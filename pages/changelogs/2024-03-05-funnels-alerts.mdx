Your product’s workflows are essentially a series of steps, which as a result leads funnel metrics to be the best indication if a product experience is normal or broken. 

So, we’ve expanded the amount of funnel metrics you can set an [Alert](https://docs.mixpanel.com/changelogs/2023-03-29-custom-alerts) on so you can have full coverage into knowing whether your product is running smoothly:

- Number of funnel conversions
- Time to convert
- Sum of a property through a funnel
- The metrics above, but for specific step ranges in a funnel

When your funnel metric is visualized as a line chart, it is also possible to use our [Anomaly Detection](https://docs.mixpanel.com/changelogs/2023-05-05-anomaly-detection-and-root-cause-analysis) feature.
