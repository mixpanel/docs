Mixpanel now supports the ability to set the timeframe of your visualization by “X”-to-date:

- Week to Date (WTD): The period from the beginning of the current week up to the present day.
- Month to Date (MTD): The interval starting from the first day of the current month up until the current date.
- Quarter to Date (QTD): The time span from the start of the current quarter (three-month period) to today.
- Year to Date (YTD): The duration from the beginning of the current calendar year to the present day.

Adjusting your visualizations to these timeframes can be a useful way to align to the way you track progress in your business.  

You can select the start of the week and the start of the quarter in your project settings.
