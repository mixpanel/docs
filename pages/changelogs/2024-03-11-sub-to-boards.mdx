Boards are a useful tool to collect a series of reports in one place, but they shouldn't be a set and forget experience. It's important to stay in the loop with how these key metrics are moving.

To keep you and your team up to date on how much progress you're making towards your metrics, you can [Subscribe to a Board](/docs/boards/advanced#board-subscriptions).

All it takes is setting the schedule of how often you want to receive this information and selecting where you want to read it (email or Slack).
Teams that are collectively informed on their data can stay on the same page, and using Subscribe to Boards can help them get there.

You can also subscribe people outside of your team to continuosly provide them a quick and meaningful insight into key metrics.
