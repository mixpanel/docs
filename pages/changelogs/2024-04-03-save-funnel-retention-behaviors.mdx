You can now save a funnel or retention behavior definition, and reuse it across your reports. This allows you standardize on a definition and feel confident in not missing any changes if you need to update a definition. This also saves time from not having to redefine your funnel or retention behavior for every report.

Note that the [behavior](/docs/reports#behaviors) is saved, and not the [metric](/docs/reports#metrics), so you can use the same funnel to in your conversion rate metric, as well as your time to convert metric.

You can save and share your behavior definitions just like a custom event or custom property. You'll be able to see all saved behaviors in Lexicon. See [docs](/docs/features/saved-behaviors) for more information on saved behaviors.
