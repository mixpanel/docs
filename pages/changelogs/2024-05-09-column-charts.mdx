You can now view your time series as a column or stacked column chart in Insights report. You can use Column charts to:

- Visualize and compare customer segments by behaviors or engagement over time
- Compare product sales performance across different regions or customer types
- Compare funnels or retention metrics
- Visualize monthly new sign-ups, active users, and churn rates
- Present financial trends and health over time

Column charts give you another way to visualize your data. Column charts tend to be better when visualizing data over shorter time frames.
