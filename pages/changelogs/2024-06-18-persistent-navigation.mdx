![Persistent Navigation](/changelog/persistent-nav.png)

Reports now keep the boards side navigation in context. Your current Board will also be highlighted on the side as you're viewing a report within a Board. You'll be able to see where you are with respect to your Boards, and easily create a new board, search, or go to Home.

As part of these changes the query builder has had its default location moved to the right of the screen. This allows for consistent placement of report tools, and makes access to report level controls easier. If you prefer to keep the query builder on the left side, you cn press the button on the bottom right of the panel to switch it back to left. This setting will be persisted for any future visit to Mixpanel.

As part of these changes we've also added keyboard shortcuts: `\`` to expand or collapse the side navigation, `Esc` to close out of a report and return the your Board.
