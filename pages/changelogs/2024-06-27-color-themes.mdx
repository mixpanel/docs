You can now set the color theme of your charts in Mixpanel. We have a few preset themes for you, but you can also create and save your own theme. You use a different theme for every report, and even have a dashboard with reports using different themes. You'll also be able to set a project wide default for color themes.

You can learn more in documentation [here](/docs/features/chart-customization#theme-customization)
