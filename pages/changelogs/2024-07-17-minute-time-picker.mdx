  title="Pick time ranges down to the minute"
/>

You choose date ranges that are specified up to the minute. If there's a metric that you want to drill in on for only a few hours, you can set your time range and see only that exact range. This saves you work from having to create a detailed time filter or custom property to do the same thing. Use this new feature to:

- Look at a metric as a trend for under a day
- Zoom into your data on trends
- Share insights on a smaller timeframe without having to zoom in again

This is supported for all chart types in Insights, Funnels, Flows and Retention.
