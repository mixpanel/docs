Everything in Mixpanel other other than events, properties, and named entities such as board and cohorts are translated. Mixpanel won't translate your data or named entities because you may attach your own meaning, and you have the ability to rename, or set a display name.
If you have any feedback on translations, whether that is something missing, or something you feel isn't quite translated correctly, please submit feedback to use [here](http://mixpanel.com/submit-feedback).
