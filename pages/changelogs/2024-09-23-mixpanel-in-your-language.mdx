Everything in Mixpanel other than events, properties, and named entities (such as board and cohorts) are translated. Mixpanel intentionally won't translate your data or named entities because you may attach your own meaning, and you have the ability to rename, or set a display name. If you have any feedback on translations, whether that is a missing translation or incorrectly translated words, please submit feedback to use [here](http://mixpanel.com/submit-feedback).
