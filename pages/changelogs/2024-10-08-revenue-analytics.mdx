Mixpanel now helps you analyze the impact of your product and marketing initiatives on your key company revenue metrics. You can now answer questions like 
- How much new revenue has been generated by this product launch? Has it grown by more than 5%?
- Why has LTV/CAC reduced, i.e why has cost of acquiring a valuable customer gone up? Which user segments are driving this?
- Which product SKUs is contributing to the most upsell revenue? Is NRR (net revenue retention) also going up accordingly? Does it differ by company size?

Irrespective of whether you have a transactions based business model or a subscription based business model, you can measure and monitor your top metrics in Mixpanel. We have built the analysis capabilities and underlying data model to ensure the difference in the business model is baked in all through, and your revenue metrics analysis are a 100% accurate.
