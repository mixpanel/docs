Mixpanel now allows you to set the units for each of your metrics. You can set the unit, the precision, and whether or not you want an abbreviated value. This gets updated for tooltips as well as in the table below the chart.

Some common uses for this:

- Create a % based formula, and add the % unit so it's clear what the metric is measuring
- Revenue based metrics, adding a $ symbol to know what currency is involved

You can also save the unit to a formula so that future uses of that formula will already be configured with the right unit. You can learn more in documentation [here](/docs/features/chart-customization#metric-units)

Note: this feature is available only for enterprise plans currently.
