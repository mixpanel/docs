![segment coloring](/changelog/segment-coloring.png)

Mixpanel now allows you to select the colors of various segments in your reports. You can choose the color for a particular segment by clicking the legend at the top of the chart. Choose between colors that exist in the theme, or choose an entirely separate color.

Some common uses for this:
- Highlight a particular segment for emphasis
- On boards with the same breakdown repeatedly, set the colors for segments so they can be aligned across the board

<div style={{position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '64.90384615384616%', height: 0}}>
    <iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/164cee809f034b6cb8db3e67adfd3d71"
        frameBorder="0"
        webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowFullScreen
        style={{position: 'absolute', 'top': 0, 'left': 0, 'width': '100%', 'height': '100%'}}>
    </iframe>
</div>

Color selection is available on both boards and reports, so you can easily update the segment colors for a report on a board as well. You can learn more in documentation [here](/docs/features/chart-customization#segment-coloring)

Note: this feature is available only for enterprise plans currently.
