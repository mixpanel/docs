Introducing Verified Content!

We’ve now made it easy for teams to identify and use “verified” metrics, events, and formulas confidently. This feature helps governors mark vetted content, making it crystal clear which metrics are trusted across the organization.

The new Verified Content feature includes:

- Badges in Lexicon: We've added a badge next to verified Events, Behaviors, Formulas, and Custom Events
- Verification Context: Hovering over badges displays who verified the item and when, adding accountability and transparency
- Verification Button in Details Page: On each item’s details page, you can verify it with a single click
- Dedicated Category in Query Builder: We introduced a Verified category in Query Builder so users can quickly filter to see only trusted content
- Verified Badge in Query Builder Context Panel: In the footer of the Query Builder’s context panel, the verified badge shows up, reassuring users that they’re working with golden metrics

Note: this feature is available only for enterprise plans currently.
