Session Replay is now available on Free and Growth plans!

- Customers on the Free plan have access to 10k free replays per month.
- Customers on the Growth and Enterprise plans have access to 20k free replays per month.
- Additional custom volumes of Session Replay are available as an add-on purchase for Enterprise plans.

To access free replays, customers will need to ensure they’re on the latest Mixpanel plans.

For customers on an existing Free plan:
- Switch your plan to the latest Free plan, which includes 1M monthly events and 10k session replays. You can make this switch directly from the pricing page.

For customers on an existing Growth plan:
- You're on the latest plan if you purchased or edited your plan after April 2024. If you're not sure if you're on the latest plan, check your plan details page (Organization Settings > Plan Details & Billing).
- You can make the switch to our latest plan directly from the pricing page.

Enterprise customers should contact their account manager to determine their plan status.
