You can now easily apply filters and breakdowns to all reports within a board. This lets you quickly analyze all reports in your board using different filters, saving you time from clicking into each report. You can also save board-level filters, ensuring consistent data analysis across your team.

Key changes in this update:

- Global Filter & Breakdown Selections: Easily set a date range, filters, and breakdowns that apply to all reports within a board.
- Saved Board Filters: Save your preferred filters to the board for easy access and consistent analysis for everyone using the board.
- Clearer Context: When viewing a report, you can now easily distinguish between board-level and report-level filters.
