Mixpanel has new customization options for the filters applied to your Boards. These Board-wide filter settings give you more control and flexibility over how people interact with your Boards.

Board-wide filter settings:

- Limit Filter Values: Improve Board clarity by limiting the number of filter values displayed. This is particularly helpful when you have a filter with a large number of values, allowing you to show only the most relevant options. For example, limit a "Country" filter to only include countries within a specific region.

- Start Filter with Nothing Selected: Guide users towards specific filtering options by pinning a filter option to the top of a board without applying any filter values. This gives anyone using the Board quick access to a filter without automatically updating the data in the Board for all users. For example, pin a "Region" filter to a board with nothing selected. By default, users will see global data and will have quick access to filter the reports down to a particular region.

Note: Currently available only for enterprise plans.
