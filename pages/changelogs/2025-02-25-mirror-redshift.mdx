description: "Mirror is a new mode on Warehouse Connectors that keeps Mixpanel in perfect sync with your warehouse. Any time data is modified in your underlying warehouse table, that change is automatically reflected in Mixpanel through change data capture (CDC). You can iteratively implement, rename or remove columns, or reconcile transactions in your warehouse without any worry of data divergence in Mixpanel. This sync enables accurate analysis for all data types, including business data that changes often like purchases."

[Mirror](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-methods/warehouse-connectors#mirror) — a sync mode keeps your data in Mixpanel fully in sync with any changes that occur in the warehouse — is now generally available for the [Redshift Warehouse Connector](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-methods/warehouse-connectors).

With Mirror, any time data is modified in your underlying warehouse table, that change is automatically reflected in Mixpanel through change data capture (CDC). You can iteratively implement, rename or remove columns, or reconcile transactions in your warehouse without any worry of data divergence in Mixpanel. This sync enables accurate analysis for all data types, including business data that changes often such as purchases.
