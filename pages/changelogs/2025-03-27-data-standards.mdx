### **Keep your data clean, consistent, and easy to understand, with Data Standards**

We’ve made it easier than ever for teams to enforce consistent, trustworthy data with our new **Data Standards** feature—now available for Enterprise customers. 
This update helps Data Governors define naming and metadata requirements — and instantly spot events that don’t comply.

The new Data Standards feature includes:

- **Custom Rules**: Define rules for naming conventions, event owners, event descriptions, and uploaded images — all from the new **Data Standards** tab in Lexicon
- **Compliance Statuses in Lexicon**: Events are automatically evaluated and flagged as compliant or non-compliant, with visual indicators for events that are misnamed or missing metadata like owners, descriptions, or images
- **Filters for Fast Cleanup**: Easily surface and fix non-compliant events using a new, dedicated filter view

Data Standards brings peace of mind to Data Governors, while making it easier for everyone else to trust and navigate the data they’re working with. 

This feature is only available on Enterprise plans. You can learn more in our [documentation here](/docs/data-governance/data-standards).

PS: up next is automation! We’re exploring how to apply automated actions when your Data Standards are met or violated,like auto-hiding non-compliant events, or automating Event Approval. Interested in early access? Reach out to your Mixpanel Account Manager
