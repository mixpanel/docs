### **Keep your data clean, consistent, and easy to understand, with Data Standards**

We’ve made it easier than ever for teams to enforce trustworthy, consistent data with our new Data Standards feature — now available for Enterprise customers. This update empowers Data Governors to define event naming and metadata requirements for their projects, and instantly spot events that don’t comply.

The new Data Standards feature includes:
- **Custom Rules**: Define rules for naming conventions, event owners, descriptions, and uploaded images — all from the new Data Standards tab in Lexicon.
- **Compliance Statuses in Lexicon**: Events are automatically evaluated and flagged as compliant or non-compliant, with visual indicators for events that are misnamed or missing metadata
- **Filters for Fast Cleanup**: Quickly surface and fix non-compliant events using a new, dedicated filter view in Lexicon

Data Standards gives Data Governors peace of mind — and makes it easier for everyone else to trust, explore, and analyze clean, reliable data.

This feature is available exclusively for Enterprise plans. Learn more in our documentation [here](/docs/data-governance/data-standards).

PS: Up next is automation! We’re exploring ways to apply automated actions when your Data Standards are met or violated — such as auto-hiding non-compliant events, or automating Event Approval. Interested in early access? Reach out to your Mixpanel Account Manager today.
