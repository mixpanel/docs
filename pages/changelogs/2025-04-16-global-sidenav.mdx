  title="An easier way to navigate"
/>

We’ve reorganized Mixpanel’s navigation into a persistent left-side panel to make getting around simpler and more intuitive. Here’s what’s new:

- **More Screen Space:** We’ve removed the top navigation bar to give you more space to work.
- **Effortless Navigation:** All your navigation is now on the left - making it easier to switch projects, create new content, and access Events, Users, Lexicon, and Cohorts seamlessly.
- **Always Accessible:** The navigation panel is always available as your navigate through Mixpanel - making it easier to get around.

How it’s organized: 

- **Top:** Project switching, creating new content, search, and quick links to Events, Users, Lexicon, and Cohorts
- **Middle:** Boards - grouped into Pinned, Favorites, and Your Boards
- **Bottom:** Settings, Help, and advanced reporting features.

**Keyboard shortcuts:** `CMD + K` Open search, ``` Expand or collapse the side navigation, `Esc` Close a report to return to your Board
