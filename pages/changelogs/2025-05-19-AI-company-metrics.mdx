When building AI products and features, we want to help you measure impact and effectiveness. You need clear answers to questions like:

- Are customers even using my chatbot?
- How much value do they get from AI outputs?
- Do improvements to my agent drive higher retention?

Our new template helps you answer these questions quickly. Get a dashboard with proven AI metrics up and running with a few clicks, so you can start understanding how AI impacts user and business outcomes.

Learn how to set up templates in our [help docs](/docs/boards/templates).
