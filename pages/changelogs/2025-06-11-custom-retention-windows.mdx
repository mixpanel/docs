  title="Custom Retention Windows for Session Replay"
/>

Enterprise customers can now define their own replay retention period—from **7 days up to 1 year**—to match their organization's compliance policies, data sensitivity, or long-term analysis needs.

Until now, Session Replay data was only retained for 30 days. This rigid default didn’t work for everyone—some teams needed shorter retention for regulatory reasons, while others needed longer retention for support escalations or long-term product decision making. This release provides the flexibility customers need to align replay retention with their unique goals.

Longer replay retention helps teams practicing digital continuous innovation by preserving rich observational data for longer. In doing so, teams can reflect on past initiatives-months after launch—and more effectively determine what bets paid off and why, helping fuel their next round of improvement
