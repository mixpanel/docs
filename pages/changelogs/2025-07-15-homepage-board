Tailor your Mixpanel experience to suit the needs of your organization. Now, project admins can set any Board in the project as the default project homepage. This means a personalized and productive start for every employee logging into Mixpanel. 

Since Mixpanel Boards are incredibly flexible, you can craft a homepage that suits your team's unique needs. Here’s how a dedicated Homepage Board can improve your team's workflow:

- **Access Key Information:** Direct your team to important documentation, onboarding guides, or key project data.
- **Streamline Onboarding:** Guide new users to intro reports and content that’s specific to your organization.
- **Highlight KPIs:** Put key KPIs front and center for your team by adding them to the Homepage Board.


Users with the project admin role can configure the project's homepage in Project Settings.
