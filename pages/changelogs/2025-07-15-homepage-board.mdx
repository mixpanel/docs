Tailor your Mixpanel experience to suit the needs of your organization. Now, project admins can set any Board in the project as the default project homepage. This means a personalized and productive start for every employee logging into Mixpanel. 

Since Mixpanel Boards are incredibly flexible, you can craft a homepage that suits your project. Here’s how a dedicated Homepage Board can improve your team's workflow:

- **Access Key Information:** Direct your team to important documentation, onboarding guides, or key project data.
- **Streamline Onboarding:** Guide new users to intro reports and content that’s specific to your organization.
- **Highlight KPIs:** Put key KPIs front and center for your team by adding them to the Homepage Board.


Users with the project admin role can configure the project's homepage in Project Settings. Removing the Homepage Board reverts the project to the default Mixpanel Home.
