Now available in Mixpanel: Heatmaps, a better  way to visually understand your customers.

Quickly see where users are clicking (and where they aren’t), spot friction points, and identify hot spots and dead zones at a glance. Use these insights to optimize page layouts, CTAs, and content based on real user interactions.

Heatmaps come included with Session Replay and are easy to enable - just change one line of code ([Read more](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/session-replay/heatmaps)). **Don’t have Session Replay enabled yet?** [Learn more](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/session-replay), or reach out to your account team to get started.
