Saved Metrics lets you standardize and reuse your KPIs throughout Mixpanel. No more data inconsistencies or wasted effort. Saved Metrics empowers your entire organization to define your most important metrics.

What’s new with Saved Metrics:

- **Standardize Definitions:** Define and save a metric definition once
- **Share Metrics:** Share your saved metrics with specific teams, individuals, or across your entire project to ensure everyone is using the same metric
- **Reuse Across Workflows:** Apply saved metrics across your reports, boards, and other Mixpanel features. Save time by using the source of truth.
- **Update with a Click:** When a metric's definition changes, update it once and those changes will automatically reflect everywhere the metric is used.
- **Clear Context:** Automatically see more details about what’s in a metric definition before you select it 
- **Multi-Group Analysis:** For customers with the Groups Add-on, you can now analyze metrics across different groups in the same report. More details [here](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/data-structure/group-analytics).

Saved Metrics enables your team to move faster, make more informed decisions, and focus on what truly matters: driving impactful business outcomes.
