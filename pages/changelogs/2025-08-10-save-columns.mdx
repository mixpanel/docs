Create stakeholder-ready reports that are polished and clear. You can now save custom column widths for the segments in table visualizations so your data always looks the way you want it to.

Whether you're analyzing top-performing pages by URL or error rates by message content, you can resize segments to see the full value and save that setting. No more clipped text, and no need to reformat every time you open a report or board.
