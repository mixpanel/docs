With Mixpanel’s new Experimentation Reports, you can monitor every experiment with any Mixpanel Metric — business, performance, or behavioral — and ensure you’re making decisions based on statistically significant results.

**What’s new:**
- **All metrics supported:** Measure impact on any new or existing Mixpanel metric
- **Decisions you can trust:** Analyze multi-variant experiments with robust statistical significance.
- **Diagnose results:** See the “why” with integrated experiment data in your behavioral analytics flow.
- **One place for all your experiments:** View and filter all active and past experiments, their results, and decisions made.
- **See the complete picture:** Link results with user behavior, cohorts, and session replays for the complete picture.

**Test, learn, and innovate faster** — all in one solution for turning data into confident decisions. [Learn More →](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/reports/experiments)
