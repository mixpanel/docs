Growth customers can now buy custom volumes of Session Replay in addition to their 20k free replays!

You've asked and we've answered: using more than 20k monthly replays is core to understanding your users. Growth customers can now purchase up to 500K monthly / 6M annual replays directly online.

To purchase more replays:

- Existing customers: you can manage your plan directly, including purchasing additional replays, from the pricing page or from your organization details page.
- New customers: during your plan purchase, you can now directly add additional replays as you build your plan.

You can view Session Replay pricing in our [plan builder](https://mixpanel.com/settings/org/plan?show-modal=plan-builder&pb-step=session-replay). For questions about billing, check out our documentation [here](/docs/pricing#how-mixpanel-pricing-works)
