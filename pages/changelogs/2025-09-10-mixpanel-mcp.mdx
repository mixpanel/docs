What if you could talk to your data using natural language? Now you can with Mixpanel MCP Server beta, democratizing analytics access across your entire organization.

### How It Works

The MCP Server acts as a bridge between AI tools like Claude and your Mixpanel data. Connect your AI assistant and ask questions in plain English like "Show me our top converting events this quarter" or "What's the retention rate for users who completed onboarding?"

### Key Benefits
Chat with your data like it's your most helpful coworker. Improve time-to-insight from "let me build you a dashboard" to "here's your answer." Empower non-technical team members to ask data questions without requiring analytics support.

### Getting Started
Organization administrators enable MCP Server access in Settings > Organization > Overview. Then connect your AI tool and start asking questions in natural language. [Learn more in our documentation](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/features/mcp).
