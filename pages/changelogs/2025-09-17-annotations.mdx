Annotations let you add time-stamped notes so you can see metrics with context that matters to you. We’ve seen teams add valuable context about everything from product launches, marketing campaigns, outages, to holidays. 

Now, you can tag and filter Annotations, enabling you to review metrics against different layers of context. Curious how your Marketing initiatives have moved Signups? Or how all the launches for a specific team have moved a KPI? Annotations with tags and filters makes this easy.

**What's new:**

- **Tag & Filter:** Add tags to your Annotations to categorize them and filter in your report so you only see what's relevant.
- **New Annotations sidebar:** See all annotations for your report’s date range in one place. 
- **Annotations on all chart types:** Previously, Annotations were restricted to time-based charts. Now, you can access this valuable context from any of your reports.
