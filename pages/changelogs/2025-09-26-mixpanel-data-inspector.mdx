Validate your Mixpanel tracking implementation with a new browser extension that provides real-time visibility into events being sent from your website.

**Why this matters**: Debugging tracking issues and validating implementation just became much easier. Instead of guessing whether events are firing correctly, you can now see exactly what data is being sent to Mixpanel in real-time.

**What you'll see**: The Data Inspector shows events as they're sent from the Mixpanel SDK, complete JSON payloads you can copy and examine, and search functionality to quickly find specific properties across events.

This enhancement streamlines the development and QA process, helping teams identify tracking issues before they reach production and ensuring data quality with greater confidence.

For installation and usage instructions, see [Mixpanel Data Inspector documentation](/docs/tracking-methods/data-inspector).
