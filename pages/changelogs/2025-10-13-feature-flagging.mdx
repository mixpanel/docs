  title="Feature Flagging — Precision control for every rollout"
/>

Feature flagging gives teams fine-grained control over who sees what and when — so you can test new features safely, measure their impact, and roll out with confidence.

**What's new:**
- **Own every stage of your rollout:** Target specific audiences and ship with confidence. Start small, expand gradually, and stay in control at every phase of your release.
- **Launch what matters, to who matters most:** Gate features by subscription tier, geography, or behavior — using dynamic Mixpanel cohorts that update automatically as users engage.
- **Move fast without breaking things:** Safeguard reliability with kill switches, throttles, and instant rollbacks — plus audit trails, QA testers, and special role-based permissions to ensure stability and confidence at scale.
- **One place to launch, learn, and grow:** Run roll outs and experiments, analyze results, watch replays and tie them directly to real user behavior — all without leaving Mixpanel.
