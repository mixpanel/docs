/>

We're excited to announce our integration with [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com), the open-source LLM engineering platform. Now you can automatically sync your AI application metrics from Langfuse directly into Mixpanel.

This integration brings three new event types into Mixpanel:

- **`[Langfuse] Trace`** - Complete LLM interactions with cost, latency, and observation counts
- **`[Langfuse] Generation`** - Individual model calls with token usage and performance metrics
- **`[Langfuse] Score`** - User feedback and quality evaluations

Answer critical questions about your AI features:

- How do AI interactions impact user retention and conversion?
- Which users are driving the most LLM costs?
- Does user feedback on AI outputs correlate with product engagement?

**Set up in minutes:**

1. Add your Mixpanel Project Token in Langfuse project settings
2. Select your Mixpanel region (US, EU, or India)
3. Enable the integration

Data syncs automatically every hour with full historical backfill.
