## Let AI do the watching for you with accurate summaries that help you understand the "why" instantly

Skip the manual replay review. With **AI Summaries**, Mixpanel automatically highlights key moments and summarizes every session, helping you get the "so what" behind user behavior in seconds.

Summaries appear right beside your replays, giving you an instant read on what happened and why. Powered by your governed event data, they're uniquely accurate, so you can trust the insights and move faster from understanding to action.
