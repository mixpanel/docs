## Find user friction fast—view frustration signals in replays and analyze them in your reports

Mixpanel now detects **Rage Clicks** and **Dead Clicks** automatically in Session Replay, helping you instantly see where users experience friction.

- **Rage Click:** When a user clicks the same spot multiple times in quick succession

- **Dead Click:** When a user clicks an interactive element that produces no visible response

These frustration signals are automatically tracked as events:

- `[Auto] Dead Click`

- `[Auto] Rage Click`

You can analyze them in reports, funnels, and dashboards just like any other event data. Find the "why" behind drop-offs and fix issues before they impact more users.
