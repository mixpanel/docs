## See engagement differences at a glance with side-by-side heatmap comparisons

Now you can compare two Heatmaps (web only) side by side to see how user engagement differs across any cut of your data, including:

- **Cohort:** Free vs. Paid

- **Experiment Group:** Test vs. Control

- **Browser:** Chrome vs. Safari

- **Time:** Current quarter vs. Last quarter

To get started, click `Compare` in the top-right corner of your Heatmap.

With **Heatmap Comparison Mode**, it's easier than ever to validate design changes, spot patterns, and identify what drives better engagement, all within Mixpanel.

Note: Heatmaps are currently only available on web.
