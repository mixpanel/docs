# MCP Support for India and EU Projects

The Mixpanel MCP Server is now available for projects hosted in India and the EU. Teams in these regions can now access the MCP server to talk with their data in natural language and democratize analytics across their organization, all while complying to local regulations.

## Getting Started

Organization administrators can enable MCP Server access in Settings > Organization > Overview.

Learn more about the MCP Server and how to get started in our [documentation](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/features/mcp).
