You can now choose between Dynamic and Manual Segments in all reports and visualizations when you add Breakdowns. 

Dynamic Segments automatically stay up to date based on how your report is sorted as your data changes. With Dynamic Segments you can create reports like:
- Funnels broken down by your top 5 app versions
- Top 15 brands by weekly purchases
- Bottom 10 pages by visits

With added flexibility for Dynamic and Manual segments, you now have control over how segments update across your reports.
