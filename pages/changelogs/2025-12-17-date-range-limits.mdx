To enable a great self-serve experience and quick queries, we have updated guardrails for Insights Reports as described below.

# Updated Date Range Guardrails for 'All Events' and Line & Column Charts

- For Line/Columns charts using “Hour” Unit, the report date range can be a maximum of 31 days
- For Line/Columns charts using “Day” Unit, the report date range can be a maximum of 12 Months
- For Insights Reports using “All Events”, the report date range can be a maximum of 93 days
- For Insights Reports using “Cohort Over Time” with Line/Column charts, the report date range can be a maximum of 93 Unit Intervals (i.e., 93 Days for Day Unit, 93 Weeks for Week Unit)


If your existing reports reach the guardrail, we recommend the following approaches to update your reports and receive the same analysis:

- Combine events into [Custom Events](/docs/features/custom-events) or [Saved Behaviors](/docs/features/saved-metrics-and-behaviors), which are not subject to the 93-day “All Events” limit.
- Utilize [Time Period Comparisons](/docs/reports/insights#time-period-comparisons) for year-over-year analysis.
- Reduce the report date range, or create multiple reports with smaller date ranges in a single [Board](/docs/boards).


# Updated Metric Block Guardrails

Insights Reports will have a 40 metric/behavior block limit. This includes all metric and behavior blocks, such as hidden metrics and formulas.


If you hit this limit, you can:
- Migrate some metrics to a new report.
- Utilize [Saved Formulas](/docs/reports/insights#save-formulas-for-re-use) if your report contains formulas.
- Combine multiple events into [Saved Behaviors](/docs/features/saved-metrics-and-behaviors#simple-behaviors).
