Use Runtime Targeting to evaluate feature flags using a live evaluation context, without storing data in Mixpanel.

With runtime targeting, you can:

- **Target instantly:** Evaluate flags using runtime properties like plan, device, or platform, or when they perform specific events tracked at runtime
- **Stay accurate:** Ensure flag decisions always reflect a user’s current state
- **Reduce overhead:** No persistence, no backfills, no user history required

Ship more precise rollouts with runtime targeting. [Learn More →](/docs/featureflags#rollout-groups)

Note: Runtime targeting is available as part of the Feature Flagging add-on for Enterprise customers. Reach out to your account team to learn more.
