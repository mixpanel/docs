/>

Starting April 2026, we will be fully retiring the `/decide` endpoint, which was used in older versions of Mixpanel SDKs.
We began deprecating this in 2022; newer SDK versions no longer rely on it.

**If you’re running an SDK version from 2022 or earlier, please review the details below.**

# How to check your project's current SDK Version:
1. In an Insights Report, select "All Events" as your primary metric
2. Break down by ["Mixpanel Library" and "Library Version"](/docs/data-structure/property-reference/reserved-properties#reserved-event-properties) event properties

Tip: You can find a list of all Projects in your Organization in [Organization Settings > Projects](/docs/orgs-and-projects/managing-projects#viewing-project-information), and use the above check to confirm which SDK and versions are in use.

# Mobile SDKs

The `/decide` endpoint controlled whether [Legacy Automatically Tracked Mobile Events](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/ios#legacy-automatically-tracked-events) `$ae_first_open`, `$ae_updated`, `$ae_crashed`, `$ae_session`, and `$ae_iap` were enabled or disabled for a Mixpanel Project.

If you currently collect these events and your Mobile SDK version does not meet the minimum versions listed below, your application will stop tracking the Automatic Mobile events after April 2026.
To keep collecting the Automatic Mobile events, please complete the following:
1. **Update to at least the minimum SDK** **versions listed below** and 
2. **Explicitly enable this tracking in your initialization code via `trackAutomaticEvents`**


Minimum Version and Guides:

# JavaScript (Web) SDK

If your JavaScript SDK version is older than the minimum version below, there will be no functionality change; however, your application will begin receiving `410` Response Error Codes from this endpoint. We strongly recommend updating to the minimum version below.
