New Enterprise accounts now have Data Volume Monitoring (DMV) enabled by default. Enterprise projects automatically monitor event volume, detect sudden or significant spikes, and notify admins so they can take corrective action quickly. No manual setup is required during project.

You can enable or disable DMV at any time from Lexicon > Data Volume Monitoring.

Learn more about DMV and configuration options in our [documentation](/docs/data-governance/data-volume-monitoring).
