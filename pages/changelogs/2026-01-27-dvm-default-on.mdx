# Data Volume Monitoring Default On for New Enterprise Customers

New enterprise accounts automatically get DVM enabled. Enterprise projects are opted into this system which automatically monitors and detects sudden, drastic changes in event volume and notifies admins for corrective action. No manual configuration is required in project settings for this feature when setting up a new enterprise project. 

## Getting Started
Customers can manually enable/disable via Lexicon > Data Volume Monitoring
