Annotations enable you to add time-stamped notes, allowing you to view metrics with the context that matters to you. We've seen teams add valuable context about everything from product launches, marketing campaigns, outages, and holidays.

Now, you can visualize all your annotations in a dedicated timeline view that shows how different types of events align across your data.

# Timeline Visualization

A new chart view displays annotations grouped by tag in separate rows, making it easy to see patterns and relationships across different event types. See at a glance when your Marketing campaigns overlapped with Product releases, or how Outages coincided with traffic spikes.

# Automatic Alignment

The timeline automatically syncs with your main chart, working seamlessly with both line and column visualizations to show annotations exactly where events occurred. No manual configuration needed - the timeline stays perfectly aligned as you zoom, change date ranges, or switch chart types.

# Interactive Exploration

- **Hover** over any annotation to preview its details
- **Click** to view the full annotation list, edit existing notes, or create new ones right from the timeline
- **Filter by tag** to focus on specific event types and hide the rest

# Tag-Based Organization

Use the tag filter to quickly analyze how particular categories of events impact your metrics. Focus on just Marketing campaigns, just Product releases, or any combination of tags that helps you tell your story.
