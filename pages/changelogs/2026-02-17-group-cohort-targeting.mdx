Feature flag rollout groups can now target **group cohorts** — cohorts built on a group key dimension such as Company, Organization, or any custom group entity.

**What's new:**
- **Target groups, not just users:** When a flag's Variant Assignment Key is set to a group key (e.g., `company_id`), the cohort builder automatically shifts its identity-dimension to that group (instead of users).
- **B2B-ready rollouts:** Build cohorts like "Enterprise companies with >50 seats" or "Organizations on the Pro plan" and target them directly for rollouts.
- **Same cohort builder:** Group cohorts are created in the existing cohort builder, scoped to the relevant group key — no new tools to learn.
- **Combine with [runtime targeting](/docs/featureflags#runtime-targeting):** Layer runtime properties (e.g., platform, region) on top of group cohort targeting with AND conditions for precise control.

Group cohorts follow the same ~2-hour refresh cadence as user cohorts.
