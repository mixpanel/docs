  title="Deprecation Notice: Legacy US-to-EU Data Forwarding ends July 2026 for EU Projects"
/>

Starting July 2026, we will be sunsetting the legacy automated US-to-EU Data Forwarding process for [EU Data Residency projects](/docs/privacy/eu-residency) to align with data residency best practices and improve ingestion performance.
After this date, data sent to our US Ingestion Servers for EU Data Residency projects will no longer be forwarded, which can result in data loss.

# Is my project affected?
- **EU Projects created before August 18, 2025: If your implementation sends data to Mixpanel's US Ingestion Servers (`api.mixpanel.com`), you may be affected by this change. Please review the action required below.**
- EU Projects created on or after August 18, 2025: These projects already require direct ingestion to our EU Servers. No action is needed.


# Required Action for EU Projects sending data to US Servers

To avoid any disruption to data ingestion for your EU Projects, **please review and update your implementations to use the dedicated Ingestion API EU Subdomain (`api-eu.mixpanel.com`).** This ensures your data is routed directly to its intended destination.

**Guidance**

1. **Verify which projects have EU Data Residency:** Navigate to [Organization Settings](/docs/orgs-and-projects/managing-projects#viewing-project-information) > Projects and click into each Project to confirm whether Data Residency is set to EU.
2. **Identify Traffic:** In your EU Project(s), create an Insights Report and break down “All Events” by the API Endpoint (`$mp_api_endpoint` ) event property to determine which Ingestion Servers your events came from. `$mp_api_endpoint=api-eu.mixpanel.com` is EU and `$mp_api_endpoint=api.mixpanel.com` or `api-js.mixpanel.com` is US.
3. **Update and Review Implementation:** If your project has EU Data Residency, please follow the guides below that apply to your setup to ensure your data routes to our EU Servers.

If you are using Mixpanel’s SDKs, the documentation linked below has instructions on updating your implementation code to EU:

- [Java](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/java#eu-data-residency)

If you are using Mixpanel’s Ingestion API Endpoints, Proxy Server, or an Implementation not listed above:
- Please update your Ingestion API Base URL to the [EU Residency Server](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/overview): `api-eu.mixpanel.com`

If you are using Partner Integrations that send data into Mixpanel (e.g., CDPs, Messaging, AB Testing):
- Please contact the Partner’s Support Team for instructions on how to set the integration to point to Mixpanel’s EU Server URL.

If you have questions about which specific projects we have observed US Traffic on or need further assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out to [Mixpanel’s Support Team](/docs/response-times#contacting-mixpanel-support).
