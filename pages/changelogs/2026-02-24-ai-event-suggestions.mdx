Setting up a new board just got a little easier.

We’ve introduced **AI-Powered Event Suggestions for Templates** to help streamline the process of mapping your events to templates, reducing guesswork and saving time during setup.

### Smarter event recommendations

When selecting a template, it’s not always obvious which events in your project correspond to each slot. Now, Mixpanel automatically suggests the best-fit events based on your existing data.

You can accept the recommendations as-is or swap in different events at any time, you’re always in control.

This update is designed to smooth out one of the more common onboarding friction points: figuring out what events you have and how to use them. With AI-powered suggestions, getting from setup to insight takes less manual effort, and less second-guessing.

You can give it a try the next time you create a board from a template.
