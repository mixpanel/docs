Growth customers now have access to powerful security and governance capabilities that give teams more control, protection, and flexibility as they scale.

### What’s now included in Growth?

#### Secure access with SSO

Strengthen authentication and simplify user management with Single Sign-On across your organization. Learn more (here)[/docs/access-security/single-sign-on].

#### Control visibility with Data Views

Create tailored views of your data so teams see exactly what they need — while maintaining appropriate boundaries. Learn more (here)[/docs/data-governance/data-views-and-classification#data-views-overview].

#### Protect data with Sensitive Data Classification

Identify and manage sensitive data with greater precision to support compliance and responsible data practices. Learn more (here)[/docs/data-governance/data-views-and-classification#data-classification].

### Raising the standard for self-serve analytics

Security and governance shouldn’t be an afterthought — or an obstacle to growth.

By bringing these capabilities to all Growth plans, we’re raising the bar for what teams should expect from a self-serve analytics platform. Organizations no longer have to choose between ease of use and robust data controls.

At the same time, our Enterprise plans continue to provide even deeper levels of governance, customization, support, and scale for organizations with the most advanced requirements.

This update ensures that as our customers grow, Mixpanel grows with them, delivering strong security foundations at every stage.

If you’re on Growth, these features are available now.

You can find more details on our growth plans [here](https://mixpanel.com/pricing/).
