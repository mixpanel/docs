To ensure we provide the most robust protection against evolving threats, we are upgrading our network security configuration. 

Starting **April 2026**, we will be deprecating support for legacy TLS 1.0 and 1.1 protocols and adopting CNSA 2.0 cryptographic algorithms across our APIs and web app.

After this date, all API requests must use at least TLS 1.2. Using at least TLS 1.2 is a recommended security best practice to improve data integrity and maintain compliance with industry standards.
