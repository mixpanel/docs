  title="Security Protocol Update: Phasing Out TLS 1.0 and 1.1"
/>

To ensure we provide the most robust protection against evolving threats, we are upgrading our network security configuration. 

Starting **April 2026**, we will be deprecating support for legacy TLS 1.0 and 1.1 protocols and adopting CNSA 2.0 cryptographic algorithms across our APIs and web app.
After this date, all API requests must use at least TLS 1.2. Using at least TLS 1.2 is a recommended security best practice to improve data integrity and maintain compliance with industry standards.

Mixpanel will also mirror the commonly accepted standards for TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 Cipher Suite compatibility, as listed in this [external resource](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Intermediate_compatibility_(recommended)).

## Updated Mixpanel Cipher Suite Support by TLS version
v1.2
- TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
- TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
- TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256

v1.3
- TLS_AES128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS_AES256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256

**What’s the impact?**

Any data sent to Mixpanel’s Ingestion API endpoints after **April 1, 2026** via TLS 1.0 and 1.1 will not be accepted, meaning you will not receive analytics information from users who engage with your applications using the 1.0 and 1.1 versions of TLS.

While the vast majority of modern traffic uses TLS 1.2 or 1.3, data can be sent to Mixpanel via TLS 1.0 and 1.1 when end-users access your application from older browsers or devices with operating systems that don’t support or enforce modern TLS versions.

For example, the following browsers and OS may still use TLS 1.0 or 1.1:

- Browsers: Chrome <84 | Firefox <78 (Released around June/July 2020)
- Mobile OS: iOS <13 | Android <10
