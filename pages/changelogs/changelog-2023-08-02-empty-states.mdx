We’re excited to announce that we have released a new design for Boards without data. Now when a report can’t populate, it will display one of two states: a faded out sample report or a “no data” status. 

![changelog Image](/changelog/empty-states-screenshot.png)

- Charts that show "no data" occur when an event has been tracked in the last 30 days, but a selected filter or date range result in no data for the report.
- If the report is configured with an event that hasn't been tracked in past 30 days or has never existed, the faded sample report will appear.

For example: a Join Membership Club event happened 100 times yesterday, but 0 today. 

- If you create a report for today, it will show “no data.”
- If it’s a new event that has never been tracked before, the report you’re trying to create will show a sample report.

This change is designed to make the experiences of creating a new Board and moving a Board to a new project easier to navigate. Nothing needs to be done to experience this new state - it is live for all users on all plans.
