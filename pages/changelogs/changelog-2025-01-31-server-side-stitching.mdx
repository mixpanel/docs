### **Watch replays for any event—even server-side**

Coming soon on all plans, exclusively at Mixpanel: **Server-Side Stitching**!

Session Replays now work for **all** your data, not just client-side or front-end events. That means you can jump straight from reports to replays, even for events tracked via APIs, sent from your data warehouse, or sent from the server-side.

Here’s what’s new:

- **Replays for your most important events** like purchases or signups—events typically tracked server-side or sent from the data warehouse. Now, you can see exactly what users did leading up to those moments.
- **No more dead ends** – Product teams track data in many ways, and now, instead of hitting empty playlists for many of your events, you can watch replays seamlessly across all data sources.
- **Complete view of the user journey** – Diagnose issues, optimize funnels, and improve your product experience with replays that work across client-side **and** server-side data.

With **Server-Side Stitching**, you get a **fuller picture of user behavior**, helping you better diagnose issues, optimize funnels, and hone your product.

This feature is **only available with Mixpanel**—no other session replay provider offers this level of visibility.

You can learn more in our documentation [here](/docs/session-replay/session-replay-web#server-side-stitching).
