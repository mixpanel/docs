Your team members access your organization and its projects using individual user accounts which is what you use to sign into Mixpanel. An account must be part of an organization but it does not need to be part of all projects in the organization.  Each account will have a single organization role per organization and one project role for each project it is a part of. These roles can further limit what an account will have access to in Mixpanel.

#### Owner

Organization Owners have administrative permissions for the organization and all the projects in the organization. Multiple users can be Owners. However, each organization must have at least one Owner.

#### Admin

Organization Admins have permissions to manage projects, members and roles in the organization. Organization Admins have the same permissions as Organization Owners EXCEPT for the following:

- Request Organization deletions
- Delete Projects
- Transfer Projects between Organizations
- Manage Billing Plans

#### Billing Admin

Organization Billing Admins can only manage billing plans for your company. The Billing Admin does not have to belong to a team or project. A user can be a Billing Admin and also a member of a Project or a Team simultaneously.

Billing admins can view organization settings solely to:

- Manage Billing Plans
- Update Billing Information
- View Receipts
- Submit a Downgrade Request

#### Member

Organization Members have no permissions to control or manage organization settings.

In order for a user to have access to project(s) and/or team(s), they must first be added to the organization as a Member.

### Project Roles

A Project has 4 roles: Owner, Admin, Analyst, and Consumer. The table below is an overview of the permissions per role on an project level.

| **Project Roles**              | **Owner**          | **Admin**          | **Analyst** | **Consumer** |

| Create Service Accounts        | ✅ | ✅ | ❌         | ❌         |

#### Owner

When a user creates a project, they own and have complete control over it. They have all permissions at the project level.

They can provision project ownership to other project users.

Organization owners have administrative permissions to assume an owner role in a project.

#### Admin

Project admins have the same set of permissions as project owners. However, they cannot delete or reset the project or manage its security.

Organization admins have administrative permissions to assume an admin role in a project.

#### Analyst

Project analysts can create and save Mixpanel reports and Boards. They can also share their saved reports and Boards, along with reports and Boards in which they have editor permissions.

Project analysts cannot manage team member roles.

#### Consumer

Project consumers can view and save their own reports and Boards. Consumers cannot share their saved reports and Boards with their team members as they will be marked as private.

Consumers can add saved reports to their own Boards. Consumers can also duplicate another user's Board and view it as a private Board.

Consumers can edit reports and Boards on which they have been added as an editor. However, consumers cannot share these reports and Boards.

Consumers cannot create public Boards.

Project consumers cannot manage team member roles.


#### Multiple Roles at Once

It is possible to have multiple or conflicting roles on a project via teams or organization roles. Within Mixpanel all roles are additive and strictly give permissions to an action. They do not remove any abilities.

For example:

1. A project Owner who is an organization Admin will have both project Owner and project Admin permissions in the project. For all intents and purposes, this is the same as having just the project Owner role.

2. If a user is assigned both the Consumer role individually and the Analyst role via a team. The user would be able to do both anything a Consumer can do and anything an Analyst can do.

## Teams

Mixpanel enables you to create and delete Teams within an organization. Teams make it easier to manage roles and permissions for a group of users. Users who are a member of a Team will be provisioned with the same role and permission that is assigned to the team. 

### Creating Teams

1. Under "Organization Settings", click **Users & Teams** and you will land on the Users tab.

1. Under "Organization Settings", click **Users & Teams** and you will land on the Users tab.
2. Select the **Teams** tab and select the team to add users to.
3. Click **Add Users** to select users to add to the team.
