The startup program empowers early startups to easily track and analyze data to find product-market fit. The program is open to early-stage startups that meet the following requirements:

- Incorporated less than five years ago
- Raised no more than $8 million (USD) in total funding
- Hasn't previously redeemed other Mixpanel offers

Eligible startups receive \$50,000 in credits that they can use over the course of 12 months. These credits can be used to purchase a Growth or Enterprise* plan as well as add-ons such as Group Analytics and Data Pipelines. Your \$50,000 in credits can purchase a plan for up to 150M events per month. All the power of Mixpanel you need to launch, grow, and scale your product.

Participants will be invited to join our exclusive Mixpanel for Startups Community in Slack where you’ll have access to curated content, workshops, resources, and opportunities to learn from other startups as well as the team at Mixpanel.

*Enterprise plans purchased with credits do not include a dedicated CSM or priority response times.

### Program FAQ

#### Will I receive help getting started with Mixpanel?

Yes! We will provide self-serve resources to help with your onboarding, invite you to attend implementation webinars, provide access to our Mixpanel Community where you’ll be able to engage with other users as well as our team, and of course, our Support team is on hand to assist with technical questions.

#### What happens after my 12 months in the startup program?

When your year in the startup program is over, our team will work with you to help you get on the best Mixpanel plan based on your usage and plans for growth. We can help you determine whether a Free, Growth, or Enterprise plan will best suit your needs going forward. If your year is almost up and you want to learn more about your options, contact your account manager or our [sales team](https://mixpanel.com/contact-us/sales/) for assistance.

#### Why do you give so many credits?

Startups are a part of Mixpanel’s DNA and we are dedicated to having the best startup program on the market and supporting as many founders as we can. The Mixpanel for Startups program provides $50,000 in credits, which is more than most of our startups ever use. However, we wanted to make sure we provide enough credits to startups that experience rapid growth in their first year and need to be on a larger data plan. Startups should focus on building world-class products and not worry about short-term trials, restrictive data plans, and hidden pricing.

### Eligibility FAQ

#### What do you consider a startup?

To be eligible for the program and considered a startup, you cannot have raised more than $8 million USD and must have been founded less than 5 years ago. If you have questions about your eligibility status, please reach out to our team at startups@mixpanel.com.

#### Do I have to be a new customer to receive a credit?

New and current customers who have not received any other exclusive offer and are not currently on a paid plan are eligible to apply.

#### What offers prevent me from qualifying for the startup program?

If you have already redeemed credits through the [Product School](https://mixpanel.com/productschool/) or another partner, you will not be eligible for the startup program.

### Credit Details

#### How do I redeem the startup program credits?

Eligible startups can [apply directly](https://mixpanel.com/startups/) for the startup program. Credits will automatically be applied to eligible line items when purchasing or upgrading to a [Growth or Enterprise plan](https://mixpanel.com/pricing/#edit-plan) via our plan builder.

Once you have the credits, you need to click 'Redeem Now' and you will be guided to our plan builder where you can select the number of events you will need, along with adding on premium features like [Data Pipelines](https://mixpanel.com/data-pipeline/) and/or [Group Analytics](https://mixpanel.com/group-analytics/). You can also access the plan builder via the Billing section in your Organization settings.

#### How are the credits applied?

Credits are applied to your monthly bill, covering up to \$50,000 in total usage per year. Any additional usage costs in excess of \$50,000 are not covered by the program and charged to the credit card on file.

#### How long are the credits valid?

The credits are activated as soon as you apply and are accepted into the program. They are valid for 12 months from the date you are accepted into the program. If you are not ready for the startup program, you can signup for a [Free plan](https://mixpanel.com/pricing/) and then apply to the startup program when you’re ready to take advantage of the offer. Startups are in Mixpanel’s DNA — so we have the most generous free plan in the market (20M events per month) to help you get started.

#### What happens if I use all my credits before my 12 months expire?

If you deplete your credits before the 12 months expire, please reach out to your account manager or our [Sales team](https://mixpanel.com/contact-us/sales/) and they will be able to talk you through your options and help make sure you can continue to use Mixpanel.

#### Can credits be applied to an annual renewal?

No, credits cannot be used at expiry to purchase an annual renewal for the following year.

#### Where can I view the credits applied to my Mixpanel account?

You can see credits in Organization Settings > Plan Details & Billing.

The Manage Billing & Payment section displays detailed information about the credits. Eligible credits will also appear in the checkout process when purchasing a Growth plan.

#### What happens if I exceed the credit available?

If you go over the total credit applied, you will be charged for the additional usage for that month to the credit card on file.

#### Do the credits expire?

Startup program credits expire 1 year after the issue. You can see the expiration date in the CREDITS tab under Billing Information in the ORGANIZATION SETTINGS Overview. Once the credits expire, the credit card on file will be charged to cover the subscription and additional data costs.

#### What happens if I send in more data than my plan allows?

For startups on an event-based plan, any event above the purchased event limit is billed at the standard base rate. We guarantee a fair price, always. We’re not going to over-charge you for events. We want you to keep your costs predictable and manageable as your business grows.

For startups on a legacy MTU plan, any monthly tracked user (MTU) above the purchased MTU limit would be billed at a metered additional data rate (120% of base rate).

For example, if you were to purchase a 100,000 MTU plan and then ended up tracking exactly 150,000 monthly tracked users (MTU) each month:

- A monthly growth plan at the 100,000 MTU rate would work out to a bill of $1190/month*
- Each additional MTU above the subscription limit of 100,000 per month costs $0.01428
- Since an additional 50,000 MTU (150,000 MTUs consumed on a 100,000 MTU plan) would be consumed each month, additional data charges will be $714/month
- Over a 12-month period, the annual cost would sum to $22,848 and this would all be covered by your credit balance*

- An annual growth plan at the 100,000 MTU has an annual subscription cost of $9999/year*
- The annual price is about 30% less than the monthly, so each additional MTU above 100,000 would be billed at a metered rate of $0.009999 per MTU
- Since an extra 50,000, MTU would be consumed each month, leading to additional data charges of $499.95/month
- Over a 12 month period, the annual cost would sum to $15,998.4* due to the additional 50,000 MTU sent each month and this will all be covered by your initial credit balance

The startup credits allow you to track approximately 430,000 MTUs each month before you run out of credits. Please reach out to our [Sales team](https://mixpanel.com/contact-us/sales/) in case your company has more users and you want to discuss other plan options.
