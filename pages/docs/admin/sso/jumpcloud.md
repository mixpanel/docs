# Jumpcloud


## Overview

Before using this document, read the general Mixpanel SSO set-up instructions.

### Configure SSO in Mixpanel

Follow the general SSO set-up instructions.

Make sure to collect your postback URL and successfully claim your domain.

### Configure the Mixpanel App in Jumpcloud
Go to Jumpcloud and create a custom application with the following values:

SP Entity ID: https://mixpanel.com/security/sso/v2/authorize/

ACS URL: https://sso.mixpanel.com/sso/saml2

Login URL: <Mixpanel's Postback URL from your org settings>

IDP Entity ID: The value itself doesn't matter much but it must be unique across all Mixpanel customers and must also be a URL, so something like https://sso.jumpcloud.com/saml2/<your-company-name>-mixpanel would work swapping in your company name. You will paste this into Mixpanel's Issuer URL field.

IDP URL: You will paste this into Mixpanel's Identity Provider Sign-in URL field

You will also want to download the IDP certificate to upload into Mixpanel

Make sure to pass through the attributes: email, firstName and lastName.
Only email is required but the other two are useful if you want to provision new users with SSO via IDP Managed Access.

Here is a screenshot of an example setup:

Optionally toggle “Require Users to Log In using SSO” to prevent your users from using a username and password to log in. Click **Enable**. Organization owners and admins will still be able to log in using username and password if SSO is not set up correctly.

### SCIM
Use SCIM with Jumpcloud at your own risk. There have been problems reported with the Jumpcloud setup process hard deleting users unexpectedly.
