> You must have a Facebook Business account connected to [Business Manager](https://audience.42matters.com/blog/how-to-connect-your-facebook-ad-account-to-business-manager-to-use-custom-audiences) to use this integration.

## Sync Types

This integration supports two types of exports: one-time export and dynamic sync. When you generate a one-time export or a dynamic sync, it overwrites the previous export with an updated export that reflects users who qualify for the cohort at the time of export.

### One-Time Export

In a one-time export, Mixpanel sends Facebook a static export of users who currently qualify for the cohort. The cohort data will not be updated in Facebook after a one-time export.

### Dynamic Sync

In a dynamic sync, Mixpanel initiates a sync between a cohort and Facebook every two hours. The exported cohort will be updated every two hours to reflect the most recent list of users in a cohort.

## Select the Cohort in Facebook Ads

You must log in to Facebook Business Manager to use the Mixpanel Cohort in Facebook Ads. Select the **Menu** in Facebook Business Manager top navigation.

Click on **Audiences**.

The Mixpanel Cohort is available in the Audience list. Cohorts are exported to Facebook Ads as `mixpanel_<Cohort Name>_<Cohort ID>`.

## Data Requirement

Meta uses _email addresses_ as the primary identifier to match users in your cohort with users in their system. If an email address is not available, Meta may instead attempt to match using other identifiers such as a _phone number_, _first and last name_, or a _device advertising ID_ (depending on your connection setup).

To use this integration, each user profile must include either an _email address_ or a _device advertising ID_. In addition to the email (if present), your system will send the following user profile properties (if available): first name, last name, phone number, advertising ID, and distinct_id. No other user properties will be exported.

If Meta is unable to match a cohort member with a user in their system, that member will be excluded from the resulting Meta audience. A lower count in the Meta audience compared to your cohort indicates that some users could not be matched.

## Troubleshooting Errors

Below are some common blocking errors (e.g. Error Message: Invalid OAuth 2.0 Access Token) that may occur when authorizing or using this connection:

#### Login Token Expired. Please disconnect and reconnect from Integrations Page.

[Facebook tokens expire after 60 days of inactivity](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/auth-vs-data/). Users will have to log in again to resume the cohort exports.

#### (#200) The current user can not update audience XXXXXXXXXXX

Verify the permissions for the user who created the sync, and then disconnect and reconnect from the Integrations page. Disconnecting and Reconnecting will resume your existing exports.

#### Error validating access token: The session has been invalidated because the user changed their password or Facebook has changed the session for security reasons.

Facebook sometimes invalidates the access token if they detect suspicious activity. Disconnect and reconnect the Facebook connection with a new token from the Integrations page to resume syncs.

#### Error validating access token: The user has not authorized application XXXXXXXXXX.

The user setting up the integration should be using a Facebook business account and have an admin role - verify these two pieces and then attempt reconnecting the integration to resume your existing exports.

#### To create or edit a Custom Audience made from a customer list, your admin needs to add this ad account to a business.

Please follow the directions here - https://www.facebook.com/business/help/910137316041095?id=420299598837059

#### To create or edit a saved audience with an uploaded customer list, please agree to the Custom Audience terms at https://business.facebook.com/ads/manage/customaudiences/tos/?act=XXXXXXXXXXX.

We generally force a window to accept the terms and conditions for the users. In rare instances where that doesn't work you can go to the above URL by replacing **XXXXXXXXXXX with your FB account ID**. Accept the terms there and then disconnect + reconnect the integration.

#### Two factor authentication required. User have to enter a code from SMS or TOTP code generator to pass 2fac.

Please disable two factor authentication and re-establish the connection from the Integrations page.

#### (#2654) Customer List Audiences Are Not Available: Ad accounts owned by businesses new to Facebook Products can create customer file Custom Audiences after several weeks of following our policies.

Please contact Facebook support to get this feature enabled for you.
