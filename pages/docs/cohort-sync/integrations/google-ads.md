# Google Ads


## Overview

Export Mixpanel cohorts to Google Ads to use targeted advertisements in Google Search. Manage the Google Ads integration from the Mixpanel integrations page. The integration currently supports data from Mixpanel into a Google Ads account.

You must be a Mixpanel project admin to use the Google Ads data integration.

## Sync Types

This integration supports two types of exports: one-time export and dynamic sync. When you generate a one-time export or dynamic sync, it overwrites the previous export with an updated export that reflects users who qualify for the cohort at the time of export.

### One-Time Export
In a one-time export, Mixpanel sends Google Ads a static export of users who currently qualify for the cohort. The cohort data will not be updated in Google Ads after a one-time export.

### Dynamic Sync
In dynamic sync, Mixpanel initiates sync between a cohort and Google Ads every two hours. The exported cohort will be updated every day to reflect the most recent list of users in a cohort.

## Select the Cohort in Google Ads

You must log in to Google Business Manager to use the Mixpanel Cohort in Google Ads. Select the **Menu** in Google Business Manager’s top navigation. 

Click on **Tools & Settings** and launch Audience Manager.

The Mixpanel Cohort is available under Audience Manager. Cohorts are exported to Google Ads as mixpanel_<Cohort Name>_<Cohort ID>.

## Data Requirements
  
Google Ads uses email addresses to match users from the cohort with users from their system. If they do not have the email address, they will instead use a combination of phone number or first and last name or the device advertising ID that you choose when setting up the connection.

In order to use this integration, **you must set an email as a user profile property or have device advertising ID**. In addition to an email address, Mixpanel sends the first name user profile property, the last name user profile property, a phone number user property, an advertising ID user property and a distinct_id. All other user properties are not exported.

Google Ads excludes cohort members from the audience if they are unable to match them with a user in their system. Inequality between the number of users in Google Audiences and the Mixpanel cohort indicates that Google was unable to find the user.
  
## Troubleshooting Errors

Below are some common blocking errors that may occur when authorizing or using this connection:

**Advertiser needs to be on the allow-list to use remarketing lists created from advertiser uploaded data (e.g., Customer Match lists).**
  
Google has to whitelist customers to use this feature. [This Google support article](https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6299717?hl=en) contains more information. Cohort exports will remain paused until it is enabled.

Please [use a valid customer id](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704344?hl=en).
 

**The customer can't be used because it isn't enabled.**
