# Iterable


## Overview

Export Mixpanel cohorts to Iterable to create user lists that you can target in your Iterable campaigns. Manage the Iterable integration from the Mixpanel integrations page.

## Permissions

You must be a Mixpanel project admin to use the Iterable data integration.

## Enable the Integration

To enable the integration, select Integrations under the Data Management tab in the top navigation bar.

The Iterable integration page will show a green export icon and details about the integration after it is connected.

If you select the US or EU Iterable data center, data will be sent to the corresponding Iterable project. Note: Every Iterable API key is associated with a specific Iterable project, which means that it's also associated with a specific data center. Further reading: https://support.iterable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043464871-API-Keys#api-keys-projects-and-data-centers

To disable the connector, select the Iterable dropdown and click **Disconnect**.

## Export a Cohort

To export a cohort to Iterable, navigate to Cohorts by clicking in the **Data Management** tab and select **Cohorts**.

Select the cohort that you want to export. Click on the three-dot icon on the right side of the cohort.

Click Export to > Iterable. Select either one-time sync or dynamic sync. Click **Start Sync**.

## Sync Types

This integration supports two types of exports: one-time export and dynamic sync. When you generate a one-time export or dynamic sync, it overwrites the previous export with an updated export that reflects users who qualify for the cohort at the time of export.

### One-Time Export
In a one-time export, Mixpanel sends Iterable a static export of users who currently qualify for the cohort. The cohort data will not be updated in Iterable after a one-time export.

### Dynamic Sync
In dynamic sync, Mixpanel initiates sync between a cohort and Iterable every fifteen minutes. The exported cohort will be updated every fifteen minutes to reflect the most recent list of users in a cohort.

## Select the Cohort in Iterable

You must log in to Iterable to use the Mixpanel Cohorts to send campaigns.

The Mixpanel Cohort is available in the Audience list. Mixpanel exports cohort data as `mixpanel_<Cohort Name>_<Cohort ID>`.

## Matching Users between Mixpanel and Iterable

> **Warning:** Projects using the [simplified ID merge system](/docs/tracking-methods/id-management#identity-merge-apis) must have the `$user_id` in Mixpanel match the user identifier in the partner service. Using any alternative partner properties to match users between tools may result in partner events not being attributed to the correct user in Mixpanel. Any partner properties mentioned in the below section are primarily applicable to projects on the original ID merge system.

The best way to match users from Mixpanel to Iterable is to set the `$iterable_user_id` profile property with the user's Iterable User ID. This also prevents Iterable from overwriting the Iterable User ID with the Mixpanel Distinct ID upon cohort sync from Mixpanel.

Iterable uses an email address to match users from the cohort with users from their system. The integration will fail if an email address is not sent. In order to use this integration, you must set email as a user profile property.

## Iterable Events into Mixpanel and MTU Exemptions

Iterable offers the ability to send events from Iterable to Mixpanel to perform deeper analysis based on messaging data. For detailed instructions, please refer to [Iterable's integration documentation](https://support.iterable.com/hc/en-us/articles/208013936-System-Webhooks-).

Events coming from Iterable are marked with the property "$source" to denote the source product.

Mixpanel will exempt certain messaging outreach events from MTU calculations, meaning you're free to send campaigns to dormant users without them counting towards MTU billing (only once a user engages with a message will they then be counted towards that tally).

The following events are exempt from MTU calculations:

- emailSend
- emailBounce
- emailComplaint
- emailSendSkip
- emailSubscribe
- emailUnSubscribe
- hostedUnsubscribeClick
- inAppSend
- inAppSendSkip
- pushBounce
- pushSend
- pushSendSkip
- smsBounce
- smsReceived
- smsSend
- smsSendSkip
- webPushSendSkip
