# Data Volume Monitoring


## Overview

Data Volume Monitoring is a Data Governance feature for organizations that want to monitor for implementation issues with events being sent to their Mixpanel project. The feature is a project-level setting for Enterprise accounts that watches for sudden, drastic changes in event volume and notifies admins so they can take corrective action.


### Enabling Data Volume Monitoring

To enable Data Volume Monitoring, navigate to the Project Settings page, select at the left-hand menu Data Governance, and click the Data Volume Monitoring toggle.

When enabling this setting, input email addresses or aliases to be notified when a spike or drop is detected. This will be gated to project admin and owner email addresses. Admins can also set up a Slack channel to be notified when a spike or drop is detected.

Notifications are sent once per day. If multiple spikes or drops are found for a project within one day, the notification will batch the notifications, so you will get at most 2 per day per project. 

Only Project Admins or Owners can enable this setting, and it's only available on Enterprise plans.
