Mixpanel allows you to export events and people data into AWS S3 through [Json Pipelines](/docs/data-pipelines)

## Setting S3 Permissions

Before detailing the steps necessary to configure permissions, it's important to note that you need to create your AWS S3 bucket.

Mixpanel supports various configurations to securely manage your data on AWS S3. For resource access, Mixpanel utilizes AWS cross-account roles. This section details the necessary permissions Mixpanel requires based on your S3 bucket configuration.

### Step 1: Create Data Modification Policy

To export data from Mixpanel to AWS S3, assign the following data modification permissions. Use the following policy, replacing `<BUCKET_NAME>` with the name of your bucket:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "MixpanelS3AccessStatement",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME>", "arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME>/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Server-Side Encryption (optional)

Mixpanel ensures data transfer to your S3 bucket over a TLS encrypted connection. To secure your data at rest in S3, enable [Server-Side Encryption (SSE)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html), which offers two options: **Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)** and **Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS)**

#### Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3)

This option encrypts your data at rest using the AES-256 algorithm, with keys managed by S3. To enable this, select `AES` from the **Encryption** dropdown menu when creating pipelines.

#### Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS)

For encryption with AWS KMS, you have the option to use either the default `aws/s3` key or your own custom keys.

- Using the Default Key

  Simply select `KMS` from the **Encryption** dropdown menu and leave the `KMS Key ID` field empty when creating your pipeline.

- Using Custom Key

  1. Select `KMS` from the **Encryption** dropdown menu and enter your custom key's ARN in the `KMS Key ID` field.

  2. Create an IAM policy allowing Mixpanel to use your KMS key, as shown in the JSON snippet below. Replace `<KEY_ARN>` with your key's ARN:

     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Sid": "MixpanelKmsStatement",
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": [
             "kms:Decrypt",
             "kms:Encrypt",
             "kms:GenerateDataKey",
             "kms:ReEncryptTo",
             "kms:GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext",
             "kms:DescribeKey",
             "kms:ReEncryptFrom"
           ],
           "Resource": "<KEY_ARN>"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

### Step 3: Create Access Role

After establishing the necessary policies, create a cross-account IAM Role to attach policies you've created:

- Go to the **IAM** service on the AWS console.
- Select **Roles** in the sidebar and click **Create role**.
- On the trusted entity page, choose **AWS Account**, then click **Another AWS account**, and enter `485438090326` for the **Account ID** and click **Next**.
- On the permissions page, locate and attach the policies you created in previous steps (data modification and, if applicable, KMS).
- On the review page, provide a name and description for this role and click **Create role**.

To ensure secure operations, limit the trust relationship to the Mixpanel export user:

- Return to the **IAM** service, select **Roles**, and locate the role you just created.
- In the **Trust relationships** tab, click **Edit trust policy**.
- Update the trust relationship with the following JSON, replacing `<MIXPANEL_PROJECT_TOKEN>` with your Mixpanel project token.

  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::485438090326:user/mixpanel-export"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
        "Condition": {
          "StringEquals": {
            "sts:ExternalId": "<MIXPANEL_PROJECT_TOKEN>"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

- Click **Update policy** and save.

This setup utilizes an external ID to prevent [the confused deputy problem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html), enhancing the security of cross-account access as Mixpanel interacts with AWS using your project token.

### Step 4: Provide Mixpanel with S3 Details

Refer to [Step 2: Creating the Pipeline](/docs/data-pipelines/#step-2-creating-the-pipeline)
to create data pipeline via UI. It is essential to provide specific details to ensure that Mixpanel can accurately direct the data exports to your S3 bucket:

- **Bucket**: Specify the S3 bucket where Mixpanel data should be exported.
- **Region**: Indicate the AWS region where your S3 bucket is located.
- **Role**: Provide the AWS Role ARN that Mixpanel should assume when writing to your S3, e.g., `arn:aws:iam:::role/example-s3-role`.
- **Encryption (optional)**: Specify the type of at-rest encryption used by the S3 bucket.
- **KMS Key ID (optional)**: If using KMS encryption, you can provide the custom key ID that you wish to use.
