# Google Cloud Storage

Mixpanel supports exporting events and people data directly to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) via [Json Pipelines](/docs/data-pipelines).

## Setting GCS Permissions

To facilitate data export to Google Cloud Storage, proper permissions need to be configured to allow Mixpanel access to your GCS bucket.

### Step 1: Assign Roles to Service Account on Bucket

You must grant the `Storage Object Admin` role to the service account `export-upload@mixpanel-prod-1.iam.gserviceaccount.com` for the bucket you are creating or intend to reuse. This role allows Mixpanel to manage storage objects on your behalf.

To assign this role:

- Navigate to the **Cloud Storage** in your Google Cloud Console and select the GCS bucket you have created or plan to reuse
- Click on the **PERMISSIONS** tab and select **GRANT ACCESS**
- In the new principals field, add `export-upload@mixpanel-prod-1.iam.gserviceaccount.com` and then select `Storage Object Admin` from the role dropdown menu
- Confirm the assignment by clicking the **SAVE** button.

This process ensures that the specified service account has the necessary permissions to efficiently manage and handle the data exported to your GCS bucket.

### Step 2: Provide Mixpanel with GCS Details

Refer to [Step 2: Creating the Pipeline](/docs/data-pipelines/#step-2-creating-the-pipeline) to create data pipeline via UI. You need to provide the following details to ensure Mixpanel can accurately direct the data exports to your GCS:

- Bucket: The GCS bucket to export Mixpanel data to
- Region: The GCS region for the bucket
