# Ad Spend

Mixpanel‚Äôs event-based-data model enables you to represent and analyze any type of data, including ad campaign performance. This guide shows you how to track this data to Mixpanel. The end result is a report that looks like this.

In this doc, we give step-by-step guidance on how to bring your advertising network data into Mixpanel to look at metrics such as ROAS (Return on Ad Spend), CPC (Cost per click) in the context of in-product conversions. We also provide detailed guides for Google and Facebook Ads. The end result should look like this:

**NOTE:** If you are a Marketer reading this, we encourage you to share this with your dev team to get this one-time setup done. This should not take more than a couple of hours.


## Understanding the Data Model

Events are the core of Mixpanel's data model. Fundamentally, an event is a row of data with a name, a timestamp, and a set of properties. This is how we can represent Ad Data as events.

```jsx
{
	event: 'Ad Data',
	properties: {
		time: 1680307200000,
		source: 'Google',
		campaign_id: 12345,

		// Cost of this campaign in USD for this day
		cost: 37.19,
		// The total clicks of this ad campaign for this day
		clicks: 11,
		// The total impressions of this ad campaign for this day
		impressions: 482,

		// metadata about the campaign; matches client side events
		utm_source: "google",
		utm_medium: "newsletter",
		utm_campaign: "Launch Commercial US",
		utm_content: "ad-text-or-variant",
		utm_term: "ad-keywords"
	}
}
```

The crux of this How To guide is turning the data exported by Ad Networks into events that look like the above.

**Best Practices**

- **Only include base metrics** cost, clicks, and impressions. We don‚Äôt need to send derived metrics like Cost-per-click, because Mixpanel‚Äôs [Custom Properties](/docs/features/custom-properties) and Formulas allow us to calculate and alter derived metrics on the fly.
- **Matching client side properties:** if you are using a Mixpanel client-side SDK to track user behaviors, you will want to model
 additional campaign metadata (source, medium, campaign, etc...) as `utm_source`, `utm_medium` etc... this matches the way mixpanel's SDKs [capture UTM params by default](/docs/data-structure/property-reference)
- **No Distinct ID:** You‚Äôll notice that our event has no Distinct ID. This is because ad performance data isn‚Äôt tied to any particular user. **This is the key difference from behavioral events.** By omitting it, we are ensuring that these events do not get erroneously included in reporting that intend to analyze user behavior such as Funnels, Retentions, Flows, unique user counts, ‚Äúdid not do‚Äù cohorts, etc.
- **Event properties are aggregated:** You‚Äôll notice the Ad-Data event in this example is scheduled to trigger only once a day. Properties are aggregated counts of all clicks through the day, all impressions through the day, all ad-spend through the day. Reason for this is ad-networks only export data at an aggregate level (without user details) and at fixed intervals (lowest granularity is generally a day)
- **Include an Insert ID:** It‚Äôs recommended to include the Insert ID property for these kinds of events. This allows you to send the campaign data to Mixpanel more than once for a particular segment without duplicating the data in reports.

The Insert ID should be made up of unique attributes in the event that separate it from other performance data.
Using our above event example, the uniquely identifiable properties are:
  - The ad network name
  - The date of the performance data
  - The campaign ID

If we were to send this data more than once to Mixpanel, we know that these 3 properties will always be constant. We can build an Insert ID from that information:

    ```jsx
    // "G" = Google Ads
    // "2023-04-01" = The date of our data
    // "12345" = The specific campaign ID

    $insert_id = `G-2023-04-01-12345`;
    ```

Note: Keep in mind the [Insert ID length limitations](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/import-events#propertiesinsert_id). If your ad network has long campaign IDs or other unique properties to use, you should use MD5 or another hashing algorithm to shorten your Insert ID.


## Gathering Data from Ad Networks

Different ad networks provide different ways to access their raw data. Some allow you to manually download a CSV export that can be transformed into the above format and sent to Mixpanel. Most networks also have APIs that allow you to automate exporting the metrics that you‚Äôre interested in.

<aside>
üí° Note: Some of these APIs require registration and permissions with the underlying platform, please read their docs to set this up.
</aside>

- **Google Ads** provides a Reporting API that can be used to extract performance data: [https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/reporting/overview](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/reporting/overview)
- Facebook provides a Marketing Insights API for ad performance metrics: [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/insights](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/insights)
- LinkedIn provides a Marketing Reporting API for ad performance data: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/ads-reporting/getting-started](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/ads-reporting/getting-started)
- Twitter provides an Ads Analytics API that can be used to extract performance data: [https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/analytics/overview](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api/analytics/overview)

## **Detailed Guides**

Below are detailed guides for Google and Facebook Ad Networks. The same general process described in these two guides can be followed for any other ad network as well by using their export APIs and pushing the data to Mixpanel.

### Google
This guide will go through setting up a serverless Google Cloud Function that will export individual ad campaign performance data from Google Ads, transform them into Mixpanel events, and send them to your Mixpanel project every day.

#### Prerequisites

In order to follow this guide, you will need:

- Mixpanel project token (can be found in Mixpanel project settings)
- Mixpanel secret token (can be found in Mixpanel project settings)
    - This is required to track back-dated events
- [Google Ads Developer Token](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/first-call/dev-token)
- An account with [Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/) access to your ad campaigns
- A Google Cloud Platform project

#### Accessing Google Ads API

Our Google Cloud Function will use the [Google Ads API](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/start) to extract relevant campaign performance data for the previous day. To access their API, we will need to create a new Google API Credential that has access to the Google Ads API.

##### Creating your Credentials

- In your Google Cloud Platform project, navigate to the [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) screen
- From the ************************************Create credentials************************************ dropdown, create a new ******************************OAuth client ID******************************
- For **********************************Application type**********************************, select ******************************Web application******************************
- Add an ************************************************Authorized redirect URIs************************************************ entry for `https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground`
    - This is only for the next step and can be removed afterwards
- ************Create************ the credential

After creating your credential, it will show you its ********************Client ID******************** and **************************Client secret**************************. Take note of those as we will need them for the next step and to access the Google Ads API.

##### Enabling Google Ads API access

We need to allow our new credential to access the Google Ads API by enabling it.

- Navigate to the [Enabled APIs & services](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard) page in Google Cloud
- Click ********************************************Enable APIs and services********************************************
- Find ****************************[Google Ads API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/googleads.googleapis.com)****************************, and press ************Enable************

##### Generating a Refresh Token

The credential you created allows Google to track access to the Google Ads API, but it doesn‚Äôt specify which Google user its acting on behalf of to retrieve the correct ad performance data. We will need to give the credential access to your Google Ads account so that it can export metrics on your behalf.

- Go to the [Google OAuth Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground#step1&scopes=https%3A//www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords&url=https%3A//&content_type=application/json&http_method=GET&useDefaultOauthCred=checked&oauthEndpointSelect=Google&oauthAuthEndpointValue=https%3A//accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth&oauthTokenEndpointValue=https%3A//oauth2.googleapis.com/token&includeCredentials=unchecked&accessTokenType=bearer&autoRefreshToken=unchecked&accessType=offline&forceAprovalPrompt=checked&response_type=code)
- Click the Settings cog in the upper right corner
    - Set **********************OAuth flow********************** to **********************Server-side**********************
    - For **********************Access type**********************, select **************Offline**************
        - This will ensure we get a refresh token, and not just a short-lived access token
    - Check the ************************************************************Use your own OAuth credentials************************************************************ checkbox
    - Fill in the ********************Client ID******************** and ****************************Client Secret**************************** from the credential that you created earlier
- In the left hand side, find ****************************Google Ads API****************************, and select it

Once you click the ******************************Authorize APIs****************************** button, it will ask you to sign in with your Google account. Make sure to sign in with the one that has access to your Google Ads account.

It will ask you to allow the credential to ****************************************************************Manage your Google Ads Campaigns****************************************************************. Click ************Accept************.

Once it generates an Authorization code, click the button that says **Exchange authorization code for tokens**.

Take note of the **************************Refresh token************************** that it generates, your function will need this to access the Google Ads API.

##### Get the customer client ID

The last piece of information we will need is the Client Customer ID. It is the ID of your Google Ads user account, which we will need to know where to pull campaign data from.

Log into [Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/), and note the numbers at the top right of the screen under your display name.
![Untitled](https://github.com/mixpanel/docs/assets/2077899/baae1f78-2640-4552-b470-71d0d00ae60f)

It should look something like: `123-456-7890`.

#### Creating the function

Now that we have all of the information we need, we can create our Google Cloud Function.

The function will run once a day, export the previous day‚Äôs campaign metrics, transform them into Mixpanel events, and import them our Mixpanel project.

- Go to the [Google Cloud Functions](https://console.cloud.google.com/functions/) page
- Click ******************************Create function******************************
- In the **********************Environment********************** dropdown, select **************2nd gen**************
- For ****************************Function name****************************, choose something informative like `mixpanel-ads-google`
- Open ********************************Runtime, build, connections and security settings******************************** and increase the **********************************Memory allocated********************************** and ********CPUs******** from the defaults
    - Depending on your ad network volume, you might want to play with these settings to process all of your data. You can always change these after creation.
- Press ********Next********
- Select **********************Node.js 18********************** as the **************Runtime**************
- For ************************Entry point************************, set it to `handler`

We will need to specify the dependencies for the function to use. Open the Inline Editor for **************************package.json************************** by clicking on it in the left navigation, and replace the contents with this:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@google-cloud/functions-framework": "^3.0.0",
    "mixpanel": "^0.17.0",
		"google-ads-api": "^13.0.0"
  }
}
```

<aside>
üí° Google doesn‚Äôt provide a first-party Ads API client for Node.js. The one we are using is third-party. More information can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-ads-api).

</aside>

For the function‚Äôs code, select ****************index.js**************** in the file tree and replace its contents with this snippet:

function fetchGoogleAdsCampaigns() {
    const customer = client.Customer({
        customer_id: GOOGLE_ADS_CUSTOMER_ID,
        refresh_token: GOOGLE_CLIENT_REFRESH_TOKEN
    });

		// Find metrics for all Google Ads campaigns that ran yesterday
    return customer.query(`

            utm_campaign: campaign.campaign.name,

            // Google's cost metric is 1 millionth of the fundamental currency specified by your Ads Account.
            cost: campaign.metrics.cost_micros / 1_000_000,
            impressions: campaign.metrics.impressions,
            clicks: campaign.metrics.clicks
        }
    };
}

/**

functions.http('handler', async (req, res) => {
  try {
		// Get the raw campaign metrics
    const campaigns = await fetchGoogleAdsCampaigns();

    // Transform our raw metrics into Mixpanel events

    // send them to Mixpanel
    mixpanel.import_batch(events, (err) => {

					throw err;
				}

				res.status(200).send(`Imported ${events.length} events.`);
    });
	} catch (err) {
		res.status(500).send(err);
	}
});
```

Change the variables at the top of the snippet to use the information we collected earlier and press ************Deploy************.

After deployment, you will see a ******URL****** at the top of the **********************************Function details********************************** screen. Save that for the next step.

Your function is now ready! When it‚Äôs triggered, it will pull your Google Ad network data and send it to Mixpanel.

#### Schedule your function

We want the function to run by itself every day so we can regularly inspect the data in Mixpanel. We‚Äôll do this by using Google Cloud Scheduler to run our Google Cloud Function every morning at 8 AM UTC.

- Navigate to the [Google Cloud Schedule](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudscheduler) page in your project
- Click ********************Create job******************** at the top of the page
- For ********Name********, choose something descriptive such as `gcf-mixpanel-ads-google-daily`
- In ******Frequency******, put `0 8 * * *`
    - This is a unix-cron expression that means to run every day at the 8th hour (8:00 AM)
    - [Google Ads has a short delay](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2544985?hl=en#:~:text=In%20most%20cases%2C%20your%20account%20statistics%20(such%20as%20clicks%2C%20conversions%2C%20and%20impressions)%20are%20delayed%20by%20less%20than%203%20hours) before metrics are available. Choosing a time sufficiently later than midnight ensures that the data will be ready for us to retrieve.
- Select ******************************************************************Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)****************************************************************** as the ****************Timezone****************
    - This can also be your local time if you prefer
- Press ****************Continue****************
