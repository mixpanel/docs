# Property Reference

## Property Types
Properties are attributes that help you define the specifics of an **Event**, a **User**, or a **Group**.
Mixpanel has many Properties defined in its Data Model.

| **Property Type** | **Description** |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| [Event Properties](/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties) | Event Properties describes the events that are tracked within your product. |
| [Super Properties](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript#super-properties) | Super Properties are a logical term for global Event Properties that, after registration, are saved into the end user's device, and appended to every event from that device until persistence is cleared. This logical term is mostly applicable to our client-side libraries. |
| [User Profile Properties](/docs/data-structure/user-profiles) | User Profile Properties describe your users (they typically store current demographical information). User profiles are joined to events based on [Distinct ID](/docs/tracking-methods/identifying-users#what-is-distinct-id). |
| [Group Profile Properties](/docs/data-structure/advanced/group-analytics#group-profiles) | Group Profile Properties describe group level information (similar to User Profiles Properties at user level). With Mixpanel’s [Group Analytics](/docs/data-structure/advanced/group-analytics), multiple users can be grouped and behavioural data analysed at a customised group level (such as company, account). Group profiles are joined to events on your chosen [Group Key](/docs/data-structure/advanced/group-analytics#group-keys-tracked-as-event-properties). |
| [Lookup Tables](/docs/data-structure/lookup-tables) | Lookup Tables allow you to dynamically extend additional properties mapped to an existing Event or User Property. For example, if you create a lookup table for "Songs" (that contains additional properties like `hash_tags`, `top_10`, `all_time_favorite`) and map it to an event property `song_id`; you can use these additional properties when doing filtering or breakdowns for events that has `song_id` as an event property. |
| [Default Properties](/docs/data-structure/property-reference#default-properties) | Default Properties (for Events and User Profiles) are collected and populated with values automatically in Mixpanel. This can happen upon data ingestion or when using certain Mixpanel client-side SDKs. Typically, they have a dollar sign ($) or “mp\_” as prefix to distinguish them from normal properties. |
| Reserved Properties | Mixpanel reserves certain property names (for [Events](/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties#reserved-event-properties) and [User Profiles](/docs/data-structure/user-profiles#reserved-user-properties)) for special use cases, and these may or may not be automatically populated with values. The purpose of such Reserved Properties are for processing (ie event time stamping) or for specific system features (eg: cohort exports). Examples: `time`, `$email`, `$phone`, `$name`, `$created`. |
 
## Default Properties
Mixpanel's [Data Ingestion APIs](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/ingestion-api) and [Client-Side SDKs](/docs/tracking-methods/choosing-the-right-method#client-side-tracking) automatically collect certain properties on every event or user profile. Do also note that some Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) that integrate with Mixpanel may also map their own properties to Mixpanel default properties. This document describes what those properties mean.

### Ingestion APIs

To disable capturing of geolocation properties (i.e. City, Region, Country) refer to the respective SDKs or API documentation. For a quick reference, refer to examples on [disabling geolocation on client-side SDKs](/docs/privacy/protecting-user-data#disabling-geolocation) and [server-side best practice on tracking geolocation](/docs/best-practices/server-side-best-practices#tracking-geolocation-http-api).

#### Event Properties

| **Raw Name** | **Display Name** | **Description** |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| $city | City | The city of the event sender parsed from the IP property or the Latitude and Longitude properties. |
| $region | Region | The region (state or province) of the event sender parsed from the IP property or the Latitude and Longitude properties. |
| mp_country_code | Country | The country of the event sender parsed from the IP property or the Latitude and Longitude properties. The value is stored as a 2-letter country code in the raw data and parsed into the country name in the UI. |
| $mp_api_endpoint | API Endpoint | Mixpanel property to record the API endpoint the data was sent to: <br /> **api.mixpanel.com** - default ingestion <br /> **api-eu.mixpanel.com** - EU data ingestion <br /> **api-js.mixpanel.com** - Javascript SDK |
| $import | Import | Internal Mixpanel property set to `true` to indicate that events were sent through [/import API](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/import-events). |
| $mp_api_timestamp_ms | API Timestamp | UTC timestamp in milliseconds when the event was received by our API. |
| mp_processing_time_ms | Time Processed (UTC) | UTC timestamp in milliseconds when the event was processed by Mixpanel servers. |

#### User Properties

Do note that Mixpanel's default user properties are only updated when you send or update at least one property yourself (via [\$set](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/profile-set) or [\$set_once](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/profile-set-property-once) operations). Please, refer to this article to [understand how to send or update profile properties](/docs/data-structure/user-profiles).

| **Raw Name** | **Display Name** | **Description** |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| $city | City | The city of the user parsed from the IP property or the Latitude and Longitude properties. |
| $region | Region | The region (state or province) of the user parsed from the IP property or the Latitude and Longitude properties. |
| $country_code | Country Code | The country of the user parsed from the IP property or the Latitude and Longitude properties. The value is stored as a 2-letter country code in the raw data and parsed into the country name in the UI. |
| $geo_source | Geo Source | Set to "reverse_geocoding" if profile geolocation properties (Country Code, Region, and City) were determined through [Latitude and Longitude](/docs/best-practices/server-side-best-practices#tracking-geolocation-latitude-and-longitude). |
| $timezone | Timezone | Timezone of the user parsed from the IP property or the Latitude and Longitude properties. |
| $last_seen | Updated at | The last time a user profile property was set or updated **(this should not be set manually)**. Passing `$ignore_time` as `true`, typically for server-side updates, will skip updating the $last_seen property. See example [here](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/php#setting-profile-properties). |


### Client-side SDKs

Note that the following SDKs wrap around our other SDKs; and as such, would also inherit the appropriate default properties from these wrapped SDKs indicated in the tables below:
- [React Native](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/react-native) wraps around Android and Swift SDK; `mp_lib` will be set to `react-native` with `$lib_version` set as React Native's library version.
- [Flutter](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/flutter) wraps around Javscript, Android, and Swift SDK; `mp_lib` will be set to `flutter` with `$lib_version` set as the Flutter's library version.

## Supported Data Types

Mixpanel supports five data types for properties: String, Numeric, Boolean, Date and List. By choosing the most suitable data type for your properties, you'd be able to apply a set of operators that are most relevant to your properties in Mixpanel reports, and this will give you richer insights about your data.

### String

- Alphanumeric value e.g. Plan Type = "Free", Artist Name = "Bruno Mars"
- String properties have a character limit of 255 bytes.
- Mixpanel will treat any property value that doesn’t match any other data type as a String.

### Numeric

- Numeric (integer or decimal) value e.g. Cost = 15.00, Quantity = 5
- You can apply operators such as sum, median and percentile on numeric properties.

### Boolean

- Mixpanel treats properties as boolean if the value is either the JSON constant `true` or `false` e.g. Favorited = true, Bookmarked = false.
- On Mixpanel, you can typecast any non-boolean property to boolean,
- "false", 0, null, undefined, and empty string will be typecasted to boolean `false`
- "true" and any set value that is not 0 or empty string will be typecasted to boolean `true`

### Date

- An ISO formatted date `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS` in UTC e.g. Last Purchase = "2022-10-30T13:30:25", Last Login = "2022-10-29". Note that all timestamps need to be sent in UTC timezone in an ISO format.
- Mixpanel treats unix timestamps as Numeric property, however, you can typecast it to Date data type.

### List

- A list of values as a JSON array e.g Favourite Genres = ["Folk","Alternative"] or Favourite Numbers = [1,5,10.0]
- Limits of a List property: Event Property = 8KB, User Profile Property = 256KB
- Each item in a list would be futher limited by their data type's limits; example: a list of strings would be limited by 255 bytes per string. Also refer to [List of Objects](/docs/data-structure/property-reference#list-of-objects) covered below.
- Mixpanel lists are not ordered (i.e. position of values in a list are not significant in Mixpanel reports) and are useful for grouping or analysing similar values across events. Read more details on [List Property Support](/docs/features/advanced#list-property-support) in reports.

## Object and List of Objects Data Types

Mixpanel also supports object and [list of objects](https://docs-git-kurbycchua-update-property-reference-mixpanel.vercel.app/docs/features/advanced#list-of-objects-property-support) data types in a limited capacity. These are typically for very specific use cases such as in e-commerce (eg Cart Items, Search Filters). It is highly encouraged that you use the five primary data types as they are fully supported in the Mixpanel UI.

### Object

- Arbitrarily-nested groups of JSON key-value pairs e.g. Experiments = {"Exp Onboarding":"Quick","Exp Checkout":"Without Coupon"}
- Limits of a Object property: Event Property = 8KB, User Profile Property = 256KB, max 255 keys per nested object with a max nesting depth of 3
- Mainly supported in core reports (i.e. Insights, Funnels, Flows, Retention, Users / Cohorts, Events) as filters and breakdowns. Property Names (ie keys) within an object are not supported in Lexicon.

### List of Objects

- A JSON array of 1 level JSON objects with each object having similar sets of key-value pairs e.g. Cart = [{"Brand":"Puma","Category":"Jacket","Price":30}, {"Brand":"Adidas","Category":"Hats","Price":15}]
- Limits of a List of Objects: Event Property = 8KB, User Profile Property = 256KB, max 255 keys and no nesting
- By default, only the first 5 objects within the list will be parsed in Mixpanel UI, more details [here](/docs/features/advanced#limits-1).
- Mainly supported in core reports (i.e. Insights, Funnels, Flows, Retention, Users / Cohorts, Events) as filters and breakdowns. Property Names (ie keys) within an object are not supported in Lexicon.
