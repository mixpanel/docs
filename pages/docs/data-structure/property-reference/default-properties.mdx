# Default Properties: Automatically collected properties
Mixpanel's [Data Ingestion APIs](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/ingestion-api) and [Client-Side SDKs](/docs/tracking-methods/choosing-the-right-method#client-side-tracking) automatically collect certain properties on every event or user profile. Do also note that some Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) that integrate with Mixpanel may also map their own properties to Mixpanel default properties. This document describes what those properties mean.

## Ingestion APIs

Mixpanel’s ingestion APIs can collect user geolocation data (City, Region, Country) as properties if IP address is present. Our client-side SDKs by default pull the user’s IP address when sending data to our ingestion APIs. The IP address is then cross-referenced against a local copy of MaxMind’s ([third-party IP geolocator](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home)) GeoIP database to estimate geolocation data. Mixpanel does not store the IP address and is discarded once geolocation data is derived.

To disable capturing of geolocation properties (i.e. City, Region, Country) refer to the respective SDKs or API documentation. For a quick reference, refer to examples on [disabling geolocation on client-side SDKs](/docs/privacy/protecting-user-data#disabling-geolocation) and [server-side best practice on tracking geolocation](/docs/best-practices/server-side-best-practices#tracking-geolocation-server-side). Note that there is currently no means to selectively disable one or two of the three geolocation properties.

### Event Properties

| **Raw Name** | **Display Name** | **Description** |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| $city | City | The city of the event sender parsed from the IP property or the Latitude and Longitude properties. |
| $region | Region | The region (state or province) of the event sender parsed from the IP property or the Latitude and Longitude properties. |
| mp_country_code | Country | The country of the event sender parsed from the IP property or the Latitude and Longitude properties. The value is stored as a 2-letter country code in the raw data and parsed into the country name in the UI. |
| $mp_api_endpoint | API Endpoint | Mixpanel property to record the API endpoint the data was sent to: <br /> **api.mixpanel.com** - default ingestion <br /> **api-eu.mixpanel.com** - EU data ingestion <br /> **api-in.mixpanel.com** - India data ingestion <br /> **api-js.mixpanel.com** - Javascript SDK |
| $import | Import | Internal Mixpanel property set to `true` to indicate that events were sent through [/import API](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/import-events). |
| $mp_api_timestamp_ms | API Timestamp | UTC timestamp in milliseconds when the event was received by our API. |
| mp_processing_time_ms | Time Processed (UTC) | UTC timestamp in milliseconds when the event was processed by Mixpanel servers. |

### User Properties

Do note that Mixpanel's default user properties are only updated when you send or update at least one property yourself (via [\$set](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/profile-set) or [\$set_once](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/profile-set-property-once) operations). Please, refer to this article to [understand how to send or update profile properties](/docs/data-structure/user-profiles).

| **Raw Name** | **Display Name** | **Description** |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| $city | City | The city of the user parsed from the IP property or the Latitude and Longitude properties. |
| $region | Region | The region (state or province) of the user parsed from the IP property or the Latitude and Longitude properties. |
| $country_code | Country Code | The country of the user parsed from the IP property or the Latitude and Longitude properties. The value is stored as a 2-letter country code in the raw data and parsed into the country name in the UI. |
| $geo_source | Geo Source | Set to "reverse_geocoding" if profile geolocation properties (Country Code, Region, and City) were determined through [Latitude and Longitude](/docs/best-practices/server-side-best-practices#tracking-geolocation-latitude-and-longitude). |
| $timezone | Timezone | Timezone of the user parsed from the IP property or the Latitude and Longitude properties. |
| $last_seen | Updated at | The last time a user profile property was set or updated **(this should not be set manually)**. Passing `$ignore_time` as `true`, typically for server-side updates, will skip updating the $last_seen property. See example [here](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/php#setting-profile-properties). |


## Client-side SDKs

Note that the following SDKs wrap around our other SDKs; and as such, would also inherit the appropriate default properties from these wrapped SDKs indicated in the tables below:
- [React Native](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/react-native) wraps around Android and Swift SDK; `mp_lib` will be set to `react-native` with `$lib_version` set as React Native's library version.
- [Flutter](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/flutter) wraps around Javscript, Android, and Swift SDK; `mp_lib` will be set to `flutter` with `$lib_version` set as the Flutter's library version.
