# Types of Properties in Mixpanel

## Overview
Properties are attributes that help you define the specifics of an **Event**, a **User**, or a **Group**.

Mixpanel has many Properties defined in its Data Model.

| **Property Type** | **Description** |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| [Event Properties](/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties) | Event Properties describes the events that are tracked within your product. |
| [Super Properties](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript#super-properties) | Super Properties are a logical term for global Event Properties that, after registration, are saved into the end user's device, and appended to every event from that device until persistence is cleared. This logical term is mostly applicable to our client-side libraries. |
| [User Profile Properties](/docs/data-structure/user-profiles) | User Profile Properties describe your users (they typically store current demographical information). User profiles are joined to events based on [Distinct ID](/docs/tracking-methods/identifying-users#what-is-distinct-id). |
| [Group Profile Properties](/docs/data-structure/group-analytics#group-profiles) | Group Profile Properties describe group level information (similar to User Profiles Properties at user level). With Mixpanel’s [Group Analytics](/docs/data-structure/advanced/group-analytics), multiple users can be grouped and behavioral data analysed at a customised group level (such as company, account). Group profiles are joined to events on your chosen [Group Key](/docs/data-structure/advanced/group-analytics#group-keys-tracked-as-event-properties). |
| [Lookup Tables](/docs/data-structure/lookup-tables) | Lookup Tables allow you to dynamically extend additional properties mapped to an existing Event or User Property. For example, if you create a lookup table for "Songs" (that contains additional properties like `hash_tags`, `top_10`, `all_time_favorite`) and map it to an event property `song_id`; you can use these additional properties when doing filtering or breakdowns for events that has `song_id` as an event property. |
| [Default Properties](/docs/data-structure/property-reference/default-properties) | Default Properties (for Events and User Profiles) are collected and populated with values automatically in Mixpanel. This can happen upon data ingestion or when using certain Mixpanel client-side SDKs. Typically, they have a dollar sign ($) or “mp\_” as prefix to distinguish them from normal properties. |
| [Reserved Properties](/docs/data-structure/property-reference/reserved-properties) | Mixpanel reserves certain property names (for [Events](/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties#reserved-event-properties) and [User Profiles](/docs/data-structure/user-profiles#reserved-user-properties)) for special use cases, and these may or may not be automatically populated with values. The purpose of such Reserved Properties are for processing (ie event time stamping) or for specific system features (eg: cohort exports). Examples: `time`, `$email`, `$phone`, `$name`, `$created`. |
