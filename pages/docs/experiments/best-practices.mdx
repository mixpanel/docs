# Experimentation Best Practices

## Hypothesis Development

### Craft Strong Hypotheses
- **Structure**: "If [change], then [outcome], because [reasoning]"
- **Specific**: Define exactly what you're changing and what you expect to happen
- **Measurable**: Tie to concrete metrics you can track
- **Time-bound**: Set clear expectations for when effects should appear

### Example Good Hypothesis
"If we add social proof badges to product pages, then conversion rate will increase by 5%, because users trust products that others have purchased."

## Sample Size Planning

### Determine Adequate Sample Size
- **Use power analysis**: Calculate required sample size before starting
- **Consider your baseline**: Lower baseline rates need larger samples
- **Factor in expected lift**: Smaller expected changes need more users
- **Account for segments**: Plan for subgroup analysis needs

### General Guidelines
- **Minimum Detectable Effect**: Aim for changes of at least 2-5%
- **Statistical Power**: Target 80% power (ability to detect true effects)
- **Significance Level**: Typically use 95% confidence (Î± = 0.05)

## Metric Selection

### Primary Metrics
- **Choose 1-2 primary metrics maximum** to avoid multiple testing issues
- **Select metrics that directly measure your hypothesis**
- **Ensure metrics are sensitive to your changes** (will move within test timeframe)

### Guardrail Metrics
- **Monitor key business metrics** (revenue, retention, satisfaction)
- **Track user experience indicators** (page load time, error rates)
- **Watch for unintended consequences** in related product areas

### Secondary Metrics
- **Help explain the "why" behind primary metric changes**
- **Provide additional context for decision making**
- **Explore user behavior patterns**

## Experiment Design

### Randomization Best Practices
- **Use proper randomization units** (typically users, not sessions)
- **Ensure random assignment is consistent** across user sessions
- **Account for network effects** when users can influence each other
- **Consider stratification** for important user segments

### Control Group Management
- **Always include a proper control group** (status quo)
- **Keep control groups large enough** for reliable comparisons
- **Avoid making changes to control** during the experiment

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

### Statistical Issues
- **Don't peek at results repeatedly** without adjusting significance levels
- **Avoid stopping experiments early** unless using sequential testing
- **Be aware of multiple testing problems** when analyzing many metrics
- **Don't cherry-pick time periods** for analysis

### Implementation Issues
- **Validate exposure event tracking** before launching
- **Test your experiment setup** with a small percentage first
- **Monitor for technical issues** that could bias results
- **Ensure consistent user experience** across variant groups

### Business Context
- **Consider external factors** (holidays, marketing campaigns, seasonality)
- **Account for learning effects** (users adapting to changes over time)
- **Plan for network effects** in social or marketplace products
- **Think about long-term vs. short-term impacts**

## Running Experiments at Scale

### Experiment Pipeline
- **Maintain a roadmap** of planned experiments
- **Prioritize based on potential impact** and ease of implementation
- **Allow adequate time** between related experiments
- **Document learnings** for organizational knowledge

### Resource Management
- **Plan engineering resources** for implementation and monitoring
- **Coordinate with marketing teams** to avoid conflicting campaigns
- **Consider user fatigue** from too many simultaneous experiments
- **Balance learning goals** with product development velocity

## Statistical Considerations

### Sequential vs. Frequentist Testing
- **Sequential Testing**: Good for detecting large effects quickly, allows early stopping
- **Frequentist Testing**: Better for small effect detection, requires full test duration
- **Choose based on your goals**: Quick decisions vs. precise measurements

### Handling Multiple Variants
- **Limit the number of variants** to maintain statistical power
- **Adjust significance levels** when making multiple comparisons
- **Plan your analysis approach** before starting the test

## Advanced Topics

### Segmentation Analysis
- **Plan key segments in advance** (new vs. returning users, etc.)
- **Use interaction effects** to understand segment differences
- **Be cautious about post-hoc segmentation** (can lead to false discoveries)
- **Consider segment size requirements** for reliable results

### Long-term Effects
- **Plan for post-experiment monitoring** to catch delayed effects
- **Consider novelty effects** that may wear off over time
- **Think about user learning curves** for complex features
- **Monitor competitive responses** that might influence results

Remember that experimentation is both an art and a science. While these guidelines provide a strong foundation, always consider your specific product context and user base when designing experiments.
