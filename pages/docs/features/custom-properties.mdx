# Custom Properties


import {Code} from 'nextra/components'

## Overview

Custom properties lets you combine existing properties into new properties on the fly, using a simple Excel-like formula language. You can then use these new properties almost anywhere that you can use regular properties, with the ability to save/share them for reuse across your team. For more on why we built this, check out [our blog](https://mixpanel.com/blog/introducing-the-mixpanel-modeling-layer/).

## Use Cases

### Grouping Marketing Channels

If you're a marketer, using Mixpanel to show the impact of various channels on acquisition, you might want to group your UTM Sources into higher level buckets. For example:
* Facebook, Instagram, Twitter => Social
* Google, Bing => Search
* Everything else => Organic

You also want to name and save this bucketing as a property that everyone else in your company can use. You can do this with custom properties:

### Compute Properties Mathematically from Other Properties

If you have an e-commerce app, you can combine "price" and "quantity" properties into a "total price" property as follows:

### Compute the Number of Days Between Two Date Properties

Use custom properties to compute the date/time difference between two date properties. You can also use the special "TODAY()" function to find the difference between a date property and the current date/time. This is ideal when you want to transform a "DateofBirth" property into “age” or a "Created" property into “days active since registration”.

A new custom property can be defined by taking into account the “Created” property and using the following transformation:

### Compare Different Properties

Use custom properties to create a new property if two property values are the same.

For example:

A company wants to find out what percentage of purchases are being made by users that have changed countries since sign up.

They can create a custom property to determine whether the two country values are the same with this transformation:

### Extract Domain from Email Address

Extract the domain of the email from an email address. You can parse out parts of a string after "@" using the SPLIT function:

### Query a List with an Index

Let’s say you have a list of recommendations as a property, and you’d like to parse out the first recommendation as another string property.

You can parse out the first delivery ID in a list property with several DeliveryIDs:

The same syntax works with objects.

## Creating a Custom Property

Click **Create Custom > Event Property or User Property** to open the property builder.

Optionally give your property a name and click into the formula bar to start defining it. If you're new to this feature, we recommend starting with one of the examples. Click the **Insert Example** drop down to populate the box with a use-case specific custom property.

When writing your formula, click **Ctrl + Space** to see a list of all the available functions and their descriptions. Click **period (.)** to search for event or user profile properties to add to the formula.

Custom properties are local to the report by default, when you select **Apply**. To save the custom property permanently for use in other reports and to make it usable by other project members, click **Save**. We recommend Apply-ing the custom property and using it in your local analysis first, before saving and sharing, to reduce clutter in the project.

When you create custom properties and select **Save as Custom Property**, your created custom property will be private by default. You can also add a description at this stage, so you and your colleagues can know what the custom property is for. You can also decide to save the custom property and **share** that custom property with specific colleagues, teams or the entire organization by clicking "**Save and Share**":

## Reference

### Functions

export const letExpression = `
// define a variable "spend" and use it in an expression

let(
  spend, <price> * <quantity>,
  ifs(
    spend < 50, "no discount",
    spend < 200, "gold discount",
    spend > 200, "platinum discount",
    TRUE, "invalid"
  )
)
`.trim()

Use the following functions in the **Formula** field to modify your custom property:

| Function | Definition | Syntax & Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| if | Evaluates if an expression is true or false. | if(condition, value if true, value if false) <br /> <br /> Example: <br /> `if(A=="Facebook" or A=="Twitter", "Social", A)` <br /> |
| ifs | Runs multiple checks and returns a value corresponding to the first true result. If no conditions are true, undefined is returned. | ifs(condition1, value1, condition2, value2, …) <br /> <br /> Example: <br /> `ifs( A<60,"Less than 1 hour",` <br /> `A<120, "More than 1 hour but less than 2 hours",` <br /> `A>=120, "More than 2 hours")` |
| not | Returns values that are not true. | not(condition) <br /> <br />Example:<br /> `not(A == "Facebook")` |
| and | Returns true if both conditions are met. Else, returns false. | x and y <br /> <br />Example:<br /> `if(A=="San Francisco" and B=="Chrome", "Valid user", "Invalid User")` |
| or | Returns true if either condition is met. Else, returns false. | x or y <br /> <br />Example:<br />  `if(A=="San Francisco" or B=="Chrome", "Valid user", "Invalid User")` |
| in | Returns true if the first condition is contained in the second condition. | x in condition <br /><br />Example:<br /> `if("Facebook" in A, "Facebook Corporation", A)` <br /> <br /> This can also be used to check against a list of values:<br /> `if(A in ["Chrome","Firefox","Edge"],"Acceptable browser","Unsupported browser")` |
| boolean | Casts the argument to a boolean. | boolean(value)->false, boolean(alternate value)-> true <br /> <br />Example:<br />  `boolean(A)` |
| number | Casts the argument to a number. | number(value to cast) <br /> <br />Example:<br /> `number(A)` |
| string | Casts the argument to a string. | string(value to cast)<br /><br /> Example:<br />`string(A)` |
| defined | Determines if a value exists. If a property is not defined on a parent event or profile, this will return false, otherwise this will return true. | defined(variable to check for existence) <br /><br />Example:<br /> `defined(A)` |
| has_prefix | Determines whether a string starts with another string. This comparison is case-insensitive. | has_prefix(string to check, prefix)<br /> <br />Example:<br />`has_prefix(A, "United")` |
| has_suffix | Determines whether a string ends with another string. This comparison is case-insensitive. | has_suffix(string to check, suffix)<br /><br />Example:<br />`has_suffix(A,"States")` |
| min | Determines the minimum value between two numbers. | min(number, number)<br /><br />Example:<br />`min(A,B)` |
| max | Determines the maximum value between two numbers. | max(number, number)<br /><br />Example:<br />`max(A,B)` |
| floor | Returns the largest integer that is smaller than or equal to the input (ie: rounds down to the nearest integer). | floor(number)<br /><br />Example:<br />`floor(A)` |
| ceil | Returns the smallest integer value greater than or equal to the input (ie: rounds up to the nearest integer). | ceil(number)<br /><br />Example:<br />`ceil(A)` |
| round | Returns the nearest integer value of the input value. | round(number)<br /><br />Example:<br />`round(A)` |
| upper | Cast string property values to uppercase. | upper(string property)<br /><br />Example:<br />`upper(A); upper("hello")` -> "HELLO" |
| lower | Cast string property values to lowercase. | lower(string property)<br /><br />Example:<br />`lower(A); lower("FacEBook")` -> "facebook" |
| regex_extract | If haystack is a string and pattern matches at least one substring, extracts the result from the first pattern match in haystack. The result is a string equal to the entire regex match, or if capture group is specified, only that portion of the match. | regex_extract(haystack, pattern, &lt;optional capture group#&gt;)<br /><br />Example:<br />`regex_extract("iPhone5.1","iPhone(...)",1)` ->5.1 |
| regex_match | Returns true if the pattern matches any part of the string. | regex_match(haystack, pattern)<br /><br />Example:<br />`regex_match("zzhaystackzz", "ha(..)ack")` -> true <br /> // Use (?-i) for case-sensitive matching: `regex_match("HAYSTACK", "(?-i)haystack")` -> false |
| regex_replace | Replaces the parts of a string that match a regular expression with a different string. | regex_replace(haystack, pattern, replacement)<br /><br />Example:<br />  // convert currency string to number: `regex_replace("$1,234,567", "[^.0-9]\*", ""))` -> 1234567 |
| datedif | Subtract two dates. Units:<br />D: days.<br />M:  months.<br />Y: years<br />MD:  days remaining after subtracting whole months.<br />YM:  months remaining after subtracting whole years.<br />YD:  days, assuming start_date and end_date are within 1 year.<br />Use TODAY() for current day. |<br />datedif(start_date,end_date,unit)<br /><br />Example:<br />`datedif(registrationdate,TODAY(), "M")` -> 5 |
| len | Returns the length of the string or the list. | len(string) or len(list)<br /><br />Example:<br /> `len("Canada")` -> 6 |
| left | Returns characters from the beginning of a given string. | left(string, num_of_characters)<br /><br />Example:<br />`left("Canada",3)` -> "Can" |
| right | Returns characters from the end of a given string | right(string, num_of_characters)<br /><br />Example:<br />`right("Canada",3)` -> "ada" |
| mid | Returns characters from the middle of a given string | mid(string, first_index, num_of_characters)<br /><br />Example:<br />`mid("Canada",1,4)` -> "Cana" |
| split | Splits a string into different parts based on a user-specified delimiter, and lets you select a particular split. Delimiter must be a single ASCII character. To fetch a list of all splits, don't pass a third argument. The first split is accessible by passing n=1 (second with n=2, ...) | split(input string, delimiter, [n: optional]) → string <br /> <br />Examples with 1 split:<br />`split("dwight@dm.com","@",2)` -> "dm.com"<br />`split("dwight@dm.com","@",4)` -> undefined<br />`split("dwight@dm.com","/",2)` -> "dwight@dm.com"<br />`split("empty//string/","/",2)` -> "" <br /> <br />Examples with all splits:<br />`split("dwight@dm.com","@")` -> ["dwight", "dm.com"]<br />`split("a/b/c/d", "/")` -> ["a", "b", "c", "d"]<br />`split("a/b/c/d", "-")` -> ["a/b/c/d"]<br />`split("a//b/c/d", "/")` -> ["a", "", "b", "c", "d"] |
| let | Define a variable and use it in an expression. This helps keep the custom property definition neat and non-repetitive. Variables are only active within the scope of the LET function. You can nest multiple let functions to define multiple variables. | let(name, definition, expression)<br /><br /><Code style={{display: 'block', whiteSpace: 'pre-wrap'}}>{letExpression}</Code> <br /> _Note: \<price> and \<quantity> are event properties._ |
| any | Evaluates to TRUE if the given expression is true for any value in the given list. The expression can refer to the current list element by the given name. | any(name, list, expr) <br /><br /> Example:<br />Let's say you had a list of numbers called priceList= [5,205,178,12,22]<br />`any(X, priceList, X > 300)` -> false.<br />`any(X, priceList, X >= 5 and X < 300)` -> true. |
| all | Evaluates to TRUE if the given expression is true for all values in the given list. The expression can refer to the current list element by the given name. | all(name, list, expr) <br /><br /> Example:<br />Let's say you had a list of numbers called priceList= [5,205,178,12,22]<br />`all(X, priceList, X > 5 and X < 200)` -> false.<br />`all(X, priceList, X >= 5 and X < 300)` -> true. |
| filter | Filters the given list to only include items for which the given expression is true. The expression can refer to the current list element by the given name. | filter(name, list, expr) <br /><br /> Example: <br />Let's say you had a list of numbers called priceList= [5,205,178,12,22]<br />`filter(X, priceList, X>100)` -> new shortened list = [205,178] |
| map | Transforms each value in the given list using the given expression. The expression can refer to the current list element by the given name. | map(name, list, expr) <br /><br /> Example:<br />Let's say you had a list of states = ["Georgia","Florida","Texas"]<br />`map(X, states, lower(X))` -> ["georgia","florida","texas"] |
| sum | Sums all numbers in the given list. Non-numeric items in the list are ignored. | sum(list) <br /><br /> Example:<br />Let's say you had a list of numbers called priceList= [5,205,178,12,22]<br />`sum(priceList)` -> 422.<br /><br />`sum(filter(X, priceList, X>100))` -> 383, because `filter(X,priceList, X>100)` -> [205,178] and `sum([205,178])` -> 383. |

### Numeric Operators

Use the following numeric operators in the **Formula** field to modify your custom property using:

- `+`: Addition. Can also be used to create a concatenation.
- `-`: Subtraction
- `*`: Multiplication
- `/`: Division
- `%`: Modulo

### Comparison Operators

Use the following comparison operators in the **Formula** field to modify your custom property:

- `<`: The first number is strictly less than the second number.
- `>`: The first number is strictly greater than the second number.
- `>=`: The first number is greater than or equal to the second number.
- `<=`: The first number is less than or equal to the second number.
- `==`: The first argument is equal to the second argument. If both arguments are strings, the comparison is case-insensitive.
- `!=`: The first argument is not equal to the second argument. If both arguments are strings, the comparison is case-insensitive.

### Constants
- `false`: Represents the literal value of boolean false.
- `true`: Represents the literal value of boolean true.
- `undefined`: Represents the literal value of cases that aren’t defined.
