# Mixpanel MCP Integration
AI-Powered Analytics Through Natural Language
---
## Overview

The Mixpanel Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration enables organizations to analyze product data using conversational AI. Teams can query events, funnels, and user behavior directly through Claude's interface using natural language, eliminating the need for complex dashboard navigation or technical query languages.

## Mixpanel MCP Tools
The MCP integration provides access to all core Mixpanel analysis capabilities through natural language queries:

### Analytics Functions

- Segmentation: Event counts and unique users with filtering and grouping (run_segmentation_query)
- Funnels: Conversion rate analysis across user journeys (run_funnels_query)
- Retention: User engagement and return behavior tracking (run_retention_query)
- Frequency: User engagement patterns and usage intensity (run_frequency_query)

### Data Discovery & Exploration

- Project Management: Access projects and workspace information (`get_projects`, `get_project_info`)
- Event Discovery: Browse all available events in your project (`get_events`)
- Event Properties: Explore properties available for each event (`get_event_properties`)
- Property Values: Discover specific values for event properties (`get_event_property_values`)
- Data Quality: Monitor and detect volume anomalies in data ingestion (`get_data_volume_anomalies`)

### Query Capabilities

- Natural Language Filtering: Use complex boolean expressions for data filtering
- Advanced Grouping: Segment data by properties with mathematical operations
- Time-based Analysis: Analyze trends across different time periods (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
- Numerical Aggregations: Perform sum, average, and bucket analysis on numeric properties

## Getting Started

### Beta Access
The Mixpanel MCP integration is currently in Private Beta. To request access, please sign up using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScOcPiQu3UP_dYBuFZ6jBIBGT-JhEU-Vgyr_o-LL3jZWqZtkQ/viewform?usp=header). Alternatively, you can reach out to your Mixpanel representative.

### Recommended Implementation Path
1. **Once you are authenticated, start by asking:** "What Mixpanel projects do I have access to?"
2. **Select a project** from the response to focus your analysis
3. **Ask any questions** about your Mixpanel data—refer to [Use Case Examples](#use-case-examples) below if you need ideas on how to get started
4. **Begin with test data** to validate functionality
5. **Conduct security review** before production data access
6. **Train teams** on natural language query techniques
7. **Expand usage** across product and analytics teams

## Use Case Examples

### Channel Performance Analysis
Query example: "Which channels drive the most users?"
Business Value: Identify top-performing acquisition channels for budget allocation

### Retention Intelligence  
**Query:** "Which channels drive users who retain best?"
**Business Value:** Understand quality vs. quantity in user acquisition strategy

### Conversion Optimization
**Query:** "Show me signup conversion rates by source"
**Business Value:** Optimize funnel performance by traffic source

### User Journey Analysis
**Query:** "What's the typical user journey for power users?"
**Business Value:** Identify patterns in high-value user behavior for product development

### Advanced Analytics
**Query:** "Compare user behavior across different feature roll outs"
**Business Value:** Measure feature impact and optimize product decisions

## Security & Compliance Considerations

### Data Handling
**Important:** This integration enables querying your Mixpanel data through Claude (Anthropic's AI service). Review your organization's data handling policies before implementation.

### Best Practices
- Implement appropriate access controls based on data sensitivity
- Monitor usage patterns and data exposure
- Consider compliance requirements (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Test with non-sensitive data first

### Recommended Security Approach
- Start with demo or test datasets
- Conduct internal security review
- Establish usage guidelines for teams
- Monitor data sharing patterns

---
