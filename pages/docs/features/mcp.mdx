# Mixpanel MCP Integration
---
## Overview

The Mixpanel Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration enables organizations to analyze product and replay data using conversational AI. Teams can query events, session replays, funnels, and user behavior through AI interfaces (Claude, Cursor, etc.) using natural language, eliminating the need for complex dashboard navigation or technical query languages.

## Mixpanel MCP Tools
The MCP integration provides access to all core Mixpanel analysis capabilities through natural language queries:

### Analytics Functions

- Segmentation: Event counts and unique users with filtering and grouping (run_segmentation_query)
- Funnels: Conversion rate analysis across user journeys (run_funnels_query)
- Retention: User engagement and return behavior tracking (run_retention_query)
- Frequency: User engagement patterns and usage intensity (run_frequency_query)

### Data Discovery & Exploration

- Project Management: Access projects and workspace information (`get_projects`, `get_project_info`)
- Event Discovery: Browse all available events in your project (`get_events`)
- Event Properties: Explore properties available for each event (`get_event_properties`)
- Property Values: Discover specific values for event properties (`get_event_property_values`)
- Data Quality: Monitor and detect volume anomalies in data ingestion (`get_data_volume_anomalies`)
- Lexicon Integration: Get direct links to event definitions and documentation in Mixpanel Lexicon (`get_lexicon_detail_url`)

### Qualitative Analysis

- Session Replays: Analyze a specific user's replays in combination with event data (`get_user_replays_data`)

### Query Capabilities

- Natural Language Filtering: Use complex boolean expressions for data filtering
- Advanced Grouping: Segment data by properties with mathematical operations
- Time-based Analysis: Analyze trends across different time periods (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
- Numerical Aggregations: Perform sum, average, and bucket analysis on numeric properties

For more information on organizing and documenting your events, see [Mixpanel Lexicon documentation](/docs/data-governance/lexicon).

## Getting Started

### Beta Access
The Mixpanel MCP integration is currently in Beta. You can start using it right away by following the [Implementation Guide](#implementation-guide) below.

### Permissions & Access Control

**Admin Configuration Required**
- **Organization administrators** must enable MCP access in **Settings > Org > Overview**
- Once enabled by an admin, all Mixpanel users in the organization can use the MCP integration
- The MCP toggle controls access for the entire organization

**User Access Scope**
After the organization admin enables MCP:
- Any Mixpanel user with any role can connect to the MCP integration
- Users can only query data from projects they already have access to within Mixpanel
- Existing Mixpanel permissions and project access controls remain in effect

### Recommended Implementation Path
1. **Organization admin** enables "Enable MCP" toggle in organization settings
2. **Individual users** complete the integration setup following the [Implementation Guide](#implementation-guide)
3. **Users authenticate** with their Mixpanel account during the connection process
4. **Once authenticated, start by asking:** "What Mixpanel projects do I have access to?"
5. **Select a project** from the response to focus your analysis
6. **Ask any questions** about your Mixpanel data—refer to [Use Case Examples](#use-case-examples) below if you need ideas
7. **Begin with test data** to validate functionality
8. **Conduct security review** before production data access
9. **Train teams** on natural language query techniques
10. **Expand usage** across product and analytics teams

### Option 2: Claude Free
**Additional Requirements:**
- Claude desktop application
- Command line access

**Setup Steps:**
1. Open Claude desktop app
2. Navigate to **Settings** (from window nav bar) → **Developer** → **Edit Config**
3. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mixpanel": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.mixpanel.com/sse",
        "--allow-http"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

4. Run authorization command in terminal:
```bash
npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.mixpanel.com/sse --allow-http
```

5. Complete Mixpanel authorization via the provided link

---

### Option 3: Cursor
**Additional Requirements:**
- Cursor application  
- Command line access

**Setup Steps:**
1. Open Cursor application
2. Navigate to **Cursor Settings** → **MCP & Integrations** → **MCP Tools** → **New MCP Server**
3. This opens MCP.json where you paste the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mixpanel": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.mixpanel.com/sse",
        "--allow-http"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

4. Run authorization command in terminal:
```bash
npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.mixpanel.com/sse --allow-http
```

5. Complete Mixpanel authorization via the provided link

---

### Option 4: Google Gemini CLI

**Additional Requirements:**
- [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google/gemini-cli) installed
- Command line access

**Setup Steps:**
1. Install the Gemini CLI by following [Gemini CLI installation instructions](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#-installation).
2. Authenticate to Google Gemini using your Google account:
   ```bash
   gemini
   ```
3. Configure Mixpanel MCP as a remote server and authorize:
   ```bash
   npx -y mcp-remote https://mcp.mixpanel.com/sse --allow-http
   ```
   Running this command will provide a link in your terminal to authorize your access with Mixpanel. Follow the authorization steps in your browser. After logging in via OAuth, you should see a confirmation message.

4. **Verify Configuration (or Create It Manually):**  
   After authorization, your `settings.json` file for the Gemini CLI should be updated automatically. You can find this file at `~/.gemini/settings.json`. To check, run:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.gemini
   cat ~/.gemini/settings.json
   ```
   The contents should be similar to the following:
   ```json
   {
     "theme": "Default",
     "selectedAuthType": "oauth-personal",
     "mcpServers": {
       "mixpanel-remote": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
           "-y",
           "mcp-remote",
           "https://mcp.mixpanel.com/sse",
           "--allow-http"
         ]
       }
     },
     "preferredEditor": "vim"
   }
   ```
   This configuration ensures that the Gemini CLI knows how to connect to the Mixpanel remote server.
   If `settings.json` is not available, create it manually using the same contents as above.
   

5. Complete Mixpanel authorization via the provided link (if not already done).
6. Run the Gemini CLI
  Once configured, you can use the Gemini CLI with the specified model by running this command:
  ```bash
  gemini
  ```
