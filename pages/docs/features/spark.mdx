# Spark

## Overview

Spark is Mixpanel’s natural language report creation tool. Launch Spark from your dashboard and ask any question about your data. You can create Insights, Funnels, Retention and Flows reports from the dashboard. You can also iterate on any prompt to drill deeper.

## Using Spark

Spark is accessed from Boards. When you choose to add content, select “Launch Spark”.

Spark will return a chart representing the answer to your question. You can click in to see what was generated, you can choose to save the report to your Board, or you can follow up with another prompt to iterate.
