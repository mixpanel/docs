# Custom Properties


import {Code} from 'nextra/components'

## Overview

Custom properties lets you combine existing properties into new properties on the fly, using a simple Excel-like formula language. You can then use these new properties almost anywhere that you can use regular properties, with the ability to save/share them for reuse across your team. For more on why we built this, check out [our blog](https://mixpanel.com/blog/introducing-the-mixpanel-modeling-layer/).

## Use Cases

### Grouping Marketing Channels

If you're a marketer, using Mixpanel to show the impact of various channels on acquisition, you might want to group your UTM Sources into higher level buckets. For example:
* Facebook, Instagram, Twitter → Social
* Google, Bing → Search
* Everything else → Organic

You also want to name and save this bucketing as a property that everyone else in your company can use. You can do this with custom properties:

### Compute Properties Mathematically from Other Properties

If you have an e-commerce app, you can combine "price" and "quantity" properties into a "total price" property as follows:
