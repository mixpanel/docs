### Compute the Number of Days Between Two Date Properties

Use custom properties to compute the date/time difference between two date properties. You can also use the special "TODAY()" function to find the difference between a date property and the current date/time. This is ideal when you want to transform a "DateofBirth" property into “age” or a "Created" property into “days active since registration”.

A new custom property can be defined by taking into account the “Created” property and using the following transformation:

### Compare Different Properties

Use custom properties to create a new property if two property values are the same.

For example:

A company wants to find out what percentage of purchases are being made by users that have changed countries since sign up.

They can create a custom property to determine whether the two country values are the same with this transformation:

### Extract Domain from Email Address

Extract the domain of the email from an email address. You can parse out parts of a string after "@" using the SPLIT function:

### Query a List with an Index

Let’s say you have a list of recommendations as a property, and you’d like to parse out the first recommendation as another string property.

You can parse out the first delivery ID in a list property with several DeliveryIDs:

The same syntax works with objects.

## Creating a Custom Property

Optionally give your property a name and click into the formula bar to start defining it. If you're new to this feature, we recommend starting with one of the examples. Click the **Insert Example** drop down to populate the box with a use-case specific custom property.

When writing your formula, click **Ctrl + Space** to see a list of all the available functions and their descriptions. Click **period (.)** to search for event or user profile properties to add to the formula.

Custom properties are local to the report by default, when you select **Apply**. To save the custom property permanently for use in other reports and to make it usable by other project members, click **Save**. We recommend Apply-ing the custom property and using it in your local analysis first, before saving and sharing, to reduce clutter in the project.

When you create custom properties and select **Save as Custom Property**, your created custom property will be private by default. You can also add a description at this stage, so you and your colleagues can know what the custom property is for. You can also decide to save the custom property and **share** that custom property with specific colleagues, teams or the entire organization by clicking "**Save and Share**":

Also note that the formula used to compose your custom property can't be longer than 20,000 characters.
