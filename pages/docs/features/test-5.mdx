Use the following functions in the **Formula** field to modify your custom property:

| Function | Definition | Syntax & Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| any | Evaluates to TRUE if the given expression is true for any value in the given list. The expression can refer to the current list element by the given name. | any(name, list, expr) <br /><br /> Example:<br />Let's say you had a list of numbers called priceList= [5,205,178,12,22]<br />`any(X, priceList, X > 300)` -> false.<br />`any(X, priceList, X >= 5 and X < 300)` -> true. |
| all | Evaluates to TRUE if the given expression is true for all values in the given list. The expression can refer to the current list element by the given name. | all(name, list, expr) <br /><br /> Example:<br />Let's say you had a list of numbers called priceList= [5,205,178,12,22]<br />`all(X, priceList, X > 5 and X < 200)` -> false.<br />`all(X, priceList, X >= 5 and X < 300)` -> true. |
| filter | Filters the given list to only include items for which the given expression is true. The expression can refer to the current list element by the given name. | filter(name, list, expr) <br /><br /> Example: <br />Let's say you had a list of numbers called priceList= [5,205,178,12,22]<br />`filter(X, priceList, X>100)` -> new shortened list = [205,178] |
| map | Transforms each value in the given list using the given expression. The expression can refer to the current list element by the given name. | map(name, list, expr) <br /><br /> Example:<br />Let's say you had a list of states = ["Georgia","Florida","Texas"]<br />`map(X, states, lower(X))` -> ["georgia","florida","texas"] |
| sum | Sums all numbers in the given list. Non-numeric items in the list are ignored. | sum(list) <br /><br /> Example:<br />Let's say you had a list of numbers called priceList= [5,205,178,12,22]<br />`sum(priceList)` -> 422.<br /><br />`sum(filter(X, priceList, X>100))` -> 383, because `filter(X,priceList, X>100)` -> [205,178] and `sum([205,178])` -> 383. |
