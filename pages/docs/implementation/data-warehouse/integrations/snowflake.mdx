Complete the following steps to get your Snowflake connector up and running:

1. Navigate to **Project Settings**, then select **Warehouse Sources**.
2. Click on `+ Add Connection` and select **Snowflake**.
3. You should see a new page to create your snowflake connector. In the first view, fill out the following fields before clicking  `Next`: 
    - Snowflake Account Name / URL
    - Username
    - Role
    - Authentication Type. We support both Password and Key Pair.
    Ensure that the corresponding commands have been successfully completed in your Snowflake instance.
        - For Password authentication:
            - Fill out the password field.
            - Copy the commands and run them within your Snowflake instance.
            - Be sure to fill out the password field in your command.
        - For Key Pair authentication:
            - Mixpanel will generate a secure key pair for your source per the Snowflake requirements.
            - The private key will be encrypted and stored securely, and used only when we need to communicate with your Snowflake instance.
            - Public key can be found in the suggested SQL to create your user.
4. In the second view, you can click `Create Source` after completing the following:
    - Warehouse
        - Enter the name of your warehouse (default value: **MIXPANEL_IMPORT_WAREHOUSE**).
        - We recommend creating a separate warehouse for Mixpanel, and ensuring that Mixpanel has the appropriate role permissions to access it.
        - Run the commands below in Snowflake.
            
            ```jsx
            CREATE WAREHOUSE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_WAREHOUSE WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = XSMALL AUTO_SUSPEND = 60 AUTO_RESUME = TRUE INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = FALSE;
            GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_WAREHOUSE TO ROLE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_ROLE;
            GRANT OPERATE ON WAREHOUSE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_WAREHOUSE TO ROLE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_ROLE;
            GRANT MONITOR ON WAREHOUSE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_WAREHOUSE TO ROLE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_ROLE; 
            ```
            
    - Storage Integration
        - This is required because Mixpanel will export the query results into a GCS bucket.
        - Default value: **MIXPANEL_IMPORT_STORAGE_INTEGRATION**
        
        ```jsx
        CREATE STORAGE INTEGRATION MIXPANEL_IMPORT_STORAGE_INTEGRATION
          TYPE = EXTERNAL_STAGE
          STORAGE_PROVIDER = 'GCS'
          ENABLED = TRUE
          STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS = ("gcs://mixpanel-2946576-ca470bce1e1ed2ec");
        GRANT USAGE ON INTEGRATION MIXPANEL_IMPORT_STORAGE_INTEGRATION TO MIXPANEL_IMPORT_ROLE; 
        ```
        
    - Database (optional)
        - Enter the name of the database you want to grant permission to.
        - By default, we request read-only access.
        - Mixpanel does not store the access information. However, you can choose to provide more granular access if you desire.
        
        ```jsx
        GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE "<your_data_base>" TO ROLE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_ROLE;
        GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "<your_data_base>" TO ROLE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_ROLE;
        GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE "<your_data_base>" TO ROLE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_ROLE;
        GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE "<your_data_base>" TO ROLE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_ROLE;
        ```

### IP Allowed List
If you are using [Snowflake Network policy](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/network-policies) to restrict access to your instance, you might need to add the following IP addresses to the allowed list.

```jsx
34.31.112.201
34.147.68.192
35.184.21.33
35.225.176.74
35.204.164.122
35.204.177.251
```
