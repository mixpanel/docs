# Sending Events 

### Format Data for Mixpanel Ingestion

To import data from a warehouse directly, you need to format tables correctly.

Each column in the table will be mapped as a property on the event. 

Read more about best practices for tracking Events and Properties in Mixpanel [here](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/how-it-works/events-and-properties).

**The following columns are required:** 

- Event Time
- Distinct ID
- Insert ID
    - This is an optional field, but we recommend it as a best practice in case duplicate events need to be reconciled.
- Insert Time
    - We expect this to be a monotonically increasing TIMESTAMP_NTZ. We use this as a water mark to figure out which events are new and ingest them.
- Event Name
    - You can specify the column that has this value.
    - Alternatively, you can specify a static value during creation.

### Event Tables

Once you have created a warehouse source, follow the below steps to send events into Mixpanel.
1. Go to Project Settings > Warehouse Data.
2. Click on + Create and select Event Table.
3. Select your warehouse as source from the dropdown.
4. Navigate to the dataset or database where your Events table is.
5. Select the Table.
6. Specify the Event Name:
    - You can specify the column which has the event name.
    - **OR** You can specify the event name for all the events.
7. Specify the Event Time:
    - This is the time the event occurred.
8. Select the column to be used for Insert ID.
9. Identity Management:
    - If your project has **Simplified ID Merge**, the warehouse connector will prompt you to map the `$device_id` and `$user_id` properties to columns in your table during setup. For more information on how we map those fields to the resulting distinct id, refer to our documentation [here](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/implementation/identifying-users#usage).
    - If your project has **Original ID Merge**, the warehouse connector will prompt you to map the Distinct ID column. This column represents the entity to which the events belong; it could be a user or a device. If you want to map two entities together you have to additionally call either `$identify`, `$merge`, `$alias` functions, along with their corresponding properties. For more information, refer to our documentation [here](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/implementation/identifying-users#how-does-the-simplified-api-differ-from-the-original-api). 
10. Check the preview to ensure that everything looks correct, and then create the event.
