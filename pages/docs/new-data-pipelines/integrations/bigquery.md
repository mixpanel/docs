# BigQuery

This guide describes how Mixpanel exports your data into a customer-managed [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) dataset.

## Design

For events data, we create a single table called `mp_master_event` and store all external properties inside the `properties` column in JSON type. Users can extract properties using JSON functions. See [Query Data](#query-data) for more details.

For user profiles and identity mappings, we create new tables `mp_people_data_*` and `mp_identity_mappings_data_*` with a random suffix every time and then update views `mp_people_data_view` and `mp_identity_mappings_data_view` accordingly to use the latest table. Always use the views instead of the actual tables, as we do not immediately delete old tables, and you may end up using outdated data.

> **Important:** Please do not modify the schema of tables generated by Mixpanel. Altering the table schema can cause the pipeline to fail to export due to schema mismatches.

## Setting BigQuery Permissions

Please follow these steps to share permissions with Mixpanel and create json pipelines.

1. Create a Dataset

   Create a dataset in your BigQuery to store the Mixpanel data.

2. Grant Permissions to Mixpanel

   > **Note:** If your organization uses [domain restriction constraint](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/restricting-domains) you will have to update the policy to allow Mixpanel domain `mixpanel.com` and Google Workspace customer ID: `C00m5wrjz`.

   Mixpanel requires two permissions to manage the dataset:

   **BigQuery Job User**

   - Navigate to **IAM & Admin** in your Google Cloud Console.
   - Click **+ ADD** to add principals
   - Add new principle `export-upload@mixpanel-prod-1.iam.gserviceaccount.com` and set the role as `BigQuery Job User`
   - Click the **Save** button.

   **BigQuery Data Owner**

   - Go to **BigQuery** in your Google Cloud Console.
   - Open the dataset intended for Mixpanel exports.
   - Click on **Sharing** and **Permissions** in the drop down.
   - In the Data Permissions window, click on **Add Principal**
   - Add new principle "export-upload@mixpanel-prod-1.iam.gserviceaccount.com" and set the role as "BigQuery Data Owner", and save.

3. Provide Necessary Details for Pipeline Creation

   When creating your pipeline, provide the GCP project ID, dataset name and GCP region as parameters.

## Partitioning

Data in the events table `mp_master_event` is partitioned based on the [`_PARTITIONTIME` pseudo column](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables#ingestion-time_partitioned_table_pseudo_columns) and in the project timezone.

Note: `TIMEPARTITIONING` should not be updated on the table. It will cause your export jobs to fail. Create a new table/view from this table for custom partitioning.

## Query Data

This section provides examples of how to query data exported to BigQuery. Refer to [BigQuery docs](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/json_functions#json_value) for more details about using JSON functions to query properties.

### Get the Number of Events Each Day

To verify the completeness of the export process, use the following SQL query to count events per day:

```sql
SELECT
  _PARTITIONTIME AS pt,
  COUNT(*)
FROM
  `<your gcp project>.<your dataset>.mp_master_event`
WHERE
  DATE(_PARTITIONTIME) <= "2024-05-31"
  AND DATE(_PARTITIONTIME) >= "2024-05-01"
GROUP BY
  pt
```

### Query identity mappings

When querying the identity mappings table, prioritize using the `resolved_distinct_id` over the non-resolved `distinct_id` whenever it is available. If a `resolved_distinct_id` is not available, you should revert to using the `distinct_id` from the existing people or events table.

Below is an example query that utilizes the identity mappings table. This query counts the number of events for each unique user in San Francisco within a specific date range.

```sql
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN m.resolved_distinct_id IS NOT NULL THEN m.resolved_distinct_id
    WHEN m.resolved_distinct_id IS NULL THEN e.distinct_id
END
  AS resolved_distinct_id,
  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM
  `<your gcp project>.<your dataset>.mp_master_event` e
INNER JOIN
  `<your gcp project>.<your dataset>.mp_identity_mappings_data_view` m
ON
  e.distinct_id = m.distinct_id
  AND JSON_VALUE(properties,'$."$city"') = "San Francisco"
  AND DATE(e._PARTITIONTIME) <= "2024-05-31"
  AND DATE(e._PARTITIONTIME) >= "2024-05-01"
GROUP BY
  resolved_distinct_id
LIMIT
  100
```

This query demonstrates how to effectively use conditional logic and JSON functions within BigQuery to analyze user behavior based on geographic location. Additional filters on event properties can be added to refine the analysis, allowing for more detailed insights into specific user actions or behaviors.
