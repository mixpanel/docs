# Mixpanel Administrative System


The Mixpanel administrative system includes organizations, projects, and teams.

An **Organization** is the controlling entity that links projects, users, and a plan together. Each organization has a single Mixpanel plan associated with it and that plan is what determines the data volume limits and features available across all projects in the organization.

A **Project** is a container for your product's analytics data, including saved entities like custom events, or saved reports. Projects house the events, properties and user profiles sent to them which can then be queried with Mixpanel’s web interface and APIs. A single organization can contain multiple projects and each project’s data tallies are summed together to give the organization-level usage.

A **Team** is a group of users in your organization that shares the same project access permission, which makes it easier to manage roles and permissions for a group of users. A team contains a roster of users, the projects they are assigned to, the role permission in each project, Data View access, and Classified Data access.
