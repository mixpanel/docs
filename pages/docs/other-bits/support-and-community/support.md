## Support Offerings & First Response Times

Our Support Engineers are located all over the world – in San Francisco, Barcelona, London, and Singapore – and we strive to respond to support issues as quickly as possible. Support offerings vary depending on your Mixpanel plan.

| Plan | Critical FRT* | Normal FRT* | Hours of Operation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Premium Plus** | 1 hour | 4 hours | 24 x 7 |
| Premium Support** | 4 hours | 8 hours | 24 x 5  |

FRT: First Response Time (within the Hours of Operation). First response times are response times within the Hours of Operation and represent target response times except for critical issues for customers on Premium Support packages.
