## Adoption Reference Guide

The power of our Mixpanel platform is that end users can self-serve to get answers to their questions. When your use cases are simpler and the number of events track are fewer, it is of course much easier for your new users to come to Mixpanel and immediately know how to work with the data. With larger enterprise teams that have larger and more complex underlying data structure, self-serve adoption can admittedly be more difficult if you don't have a data democratization process in place.

What we've seen work for our largest customers with strong company-wide adoption is the appointment of an internal company champion to oversee the adoption of product analytics. This would include setting up onboarding for new users, training users on data governance best practices, and creating resources like videos and dashboards. Your champion becomes the “go-to” person that can answer the team’s specific questions about the product analytics tool.

In the following link, we've consolidated a set of similar reference materials that you can leverage to similarly help your teams onboard and self-serve with Mixpanel. Contained in this guide are support, training, project-specific resources, metrics, and objective stores and resources to request additional data.
