## Overview of Tutorial: Mixpanel for Developers
We've broken down the Mixpanel for Developers tutorial into a couple of different modules to help you understand events and properties in Mixpanel, understand the data types it supports and how to send events to Mixpanel and enrich user data that have been documented in your Tracking Plan.

We also explore Mixpanelâ€™s identity management on how to identify visitors as they go from an anonymous state to a known state even when visitors use different devices.
