## Our Data Model Overview

Unlike some other analytics tools which are limited to tracking pre-defined measures of engagement, such as page views and browser sessions, Mixpanel employs an event-based, user-centric model that tracks the specific actions that individual users take within your product.

This event-based approach to analytics captures a deeper understanding of user engagement, which allows for more granular analysis and effective targeting of messages and experiments.

As for the actual structure of the Mixpanel data model, it is built on three key concepts: events, properties, and user profiles.

## How Group Analytics Works
We also have Group Analytics in Mixpanel, which allows behavioral data analysis at a customized group level (such as account, deviceâ€”or any other way you want to assess your business). You can read up more about Group Analytics and how to set it up [here](/docs/analysis/advanced/group-analytics), but here, we'll walk through some use cases of group analytics and how you can use it. To follow along, you can use this [demo data set.](https://mixpanel.com/s/1M3OI6)
