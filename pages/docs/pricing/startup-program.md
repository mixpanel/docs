The program allows startups to track up to 100M events per month, or 1.2B events per year. All the power of Mixpanel you need to launch, grow, and scale your product.

### Program FAQ

#### Will I receive help getting started with Mixpanel?

Yes! We will provide self-serve resources to help with your onboarding, invite you to attend implementation webinars, provide access to our Mixpanel Community where you’ll be able to engage with other users as well as our team, and of course, our Support team is on hand to assist with technical questions.

#### What happens after my 12 months in the startup program?

When your year in the startup program is over, our team will work with you to help you get on the best Mixpanel plan based on your usage and plans for growth. We can help you determine whether a Free, Growth, or Enterprise plan will best suit your needs going forward. If your year is almost up and you want to learn more about your options, contact your account manager or our [sales team](https://mixpanel.com/contact-us/sales/) for assistance.

#### Why is the startup program offer so generous?

Startups are a part of Mixpanel’s DNA and we are dedicated to having the best startup program on the market and supporting as many founders as we can. The Mixpanel for Startups program provides the first year free, valued up to \$50,000. Most of our startups' usage does not come close to \$50,000. However, we wanted to make sure we provide enough value to cover startups that experience rapid growth in their first year and need to be on a larger data plan. Startups should focus on building world-class products and not worry about short-term trials, restrictive data plans, and hidden pricing.

### Eligibility FAQ

#### What do you consider a startup?

To be eligible for the program and considered a startup, you cannot have raised more than $8 million USD and must have been founded less than 5 years ago. If you have questions about your eligibility status, please reach out to our team at [startups@mixpanel.com](mailto:startups@mixpanel.com).

#### Do I have to be a new customer to receive a credit?

#### What offers prevent me from qualifying for the startup program?

If you have already redeemed an offer through the [Product School](https://productschool.teachable.com/p/productanalytics) or another partner, you will not be eligible for the startup program.

### Offer Details

#### How do I redeem the startup program offer?

Eligible startups can [apply directly](https://mixpanel.com/startups-apply/) for the startup program. Credits will be added to your account and automatically be applied to eligible line items when purchasing or upgrading to an annual [Growth plan](https://mixpanel.com/pricing/#edit-plan) via our plan builder.

The offer is activated as soon as you successfully apply and are approved for the program. From that date, you will begin your one free year of Mixpanel.

#### How does the startup program work?

Once accepted into the program, \$50,000 worth of credits will be added to your account. These credits are applied to your monthly bill, covering up to \$50,000 in total usage per year. Any additional usage costs in excess of \$50,000 are not covered by the program and charged to the credit card on file.

#### When does my one free year begin?

The startup program offer is activated as soon as you apply and are accepted into the program. After you are accepted, you will be directed to our plan builder where you can purchase an annual plan and premium features. Your one free year will begin once you are accepted. If you are not ready for the startup program, you can signup for a [Free plan](https://mixpanel.com/pricing/) and then apply to the startup program when you’re ready to take advantage of the offer. Startups are in Mixpanel’s DNA — so we have the most generous free plan in the market (20M events per month) to help you get started.

#### What happens if my usage exceeds \$50,000 within the first year?

If your usage goes over \$50,000, you will be charged for the additional usage for that month to the credit card on file. Please reach out to your account manager or our [Sales team](https://mixpanel.com/contact-us/sales/) and they will be able to talk you through your options and help make sure you can continue to use Mixpanel.

#### Can I continue with the startup program after the first year and receive a second year free?

No, the Mixpanel for Startups program offers eligible companies their first year of Mixpanel for free. After the first year, startups are able to move to a Free, Growth, or Enterprise plan.

#### Where can I view the startup program offer applied to my Mixpanel account?

When you join the program, \$50,000 worth of credits will be added to your account to apply to eligible purchases and upgrades made in your first year. You can see these credits in Organization Settings > Plan Details & Billing. 

The Manage Billing & Payment section displays detailed information about the credits that are used to cover your first year of Mixpanel. Eligible credits will also appear in the checkout process when purchasing a Growth plan and premium features.

#### Will the credits in my account expire?

Yes, the startup program provides your first year of Mixpanel for free, valued up to \$50,000. After the first year, the unused credits will expire and no longer be valid. You can see the expiration date in the Credits tab under Plan Details & Billing in the Organization Settings. Once your first year elapses, the credits expire and the credit card on file will be charged to cover the subscription renewal and additional data costs.

#### What happens if I send in more data than my plan allows?

For startups on an event-based plan, any event above the purchased event limit is billed at the standard base rate. We guarantee a fair price, always. We’re not going to over-charge you for events. We want you to keep your costs predictable and manageable as your business grows.

For startups on a legacy MTU plan, any monthly tracked user (MTU) above the purchased MTU limit would be billed at a metered additional data rate (120% of base rate).

For example, if you were to purchase a 100,000 MTU plan and then ended up tracking exactly 150,000 monthly tracked users (MTU) each month:

- A monthly growth plan at the 100,000 MTU rate would work out to a bill of $1190/month*
- Each additional MTU above the subscription limit of 100,000 per month costs $0.01428
- Since an additional 50,000 MTU (150,000 MTUs consumed on a 100,000 MTU plan) would be consumed each month, additional data charges will be $714/month
- Over a 12-month period, the annual cost would sum to $22,848 and this would all be covered by your credit balance in the first year.*

- An annual growth plan at the 100,000 MTU has an annual subscription cost of $9999/year*
- The annual price is about 30% less than the monthly, so each additional MTU above 100,000 would be billed at a metered rate of $0.009999 per MTU
- Since an extra 50,000, MTU would be consumed each month, leading to additional data charges of $499.95/month
- Over a 12 month period, the annual cost would sum to $15,998.4* due to the additional 50,000 MTU sent each month and this will all be covered by your initial credit balance in the first year.

If you are on a legacy MTU plan, the startup program allows you to track approximately 430,000 MTUs each month before you exceed the \$50,000 value of the offer. Please reach out to our [Sales team](https://mixpanel.com/contact-us/sales/) in case your company has more users and you want to discuss other plan options.
