# Startup Program: Use Mixpanel for free for the first year

The Mixpanel for Startups program empowers early-stage companies to easily track and analyze data to find product-market fit and more. The program is open to startups that meet the following requirements:

- Incorporated less than five years ago.
- Raised no more than $8 million (USD) in total funding.
- Haven't previously redeemed other Mixpanel offers.
- Haven’t been on a paid plan. 

Eligible startups receive their first year free on the Startup Plan, an exclusive offering for startup program participants. The Startup Plan allows you to take advantage of the full analytics capabilities of Mixpanel, without any feature limits. This includes access to all enterprise-level reports such as [Signal](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/reports/apps/signal) and [Experiments](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/reports/apps/experiments), as well as our add-on packages (Data Pipelines, Group Analytics, Warehouse Connectors). The Startup Plan covers data volumes of up to 1 billion events per year. With the Startup Plan, unlock all the power of Mixpanel you'll need to launch, grow, and scale your product.

In order to maintain status in the program, participants must begin sending data to Mixpanel within 90 days of acceptance. If you are not ready to begin implementation, we encourage you to wait and apply once ready.

Participants will be invited to join our exclusive Mixpanel for Startups Community in Slack where you’ll have access to curated content, workshops, resources, and opportunities to learn from other startups as well as the team at Mixpanel.

### Startup Plan Details
#### What is included in the Startup Plan?
The Startup Plan has been designed specifically for participants in the Mixpanel for Startups program and includes premium features as well as our add-on packages (Data Pipelines, Group Analytics, Warehouse Connectors). The plan is valid for 12 months and allows you to send up to 1B events to Mixpanel. 
The Startup Plan is not eligible for BAAs or MSAs. 

#### What is the implementation requirement?
The startup program provides access to all Mixpanel’s features and functionality for free, for one year. We encourage startups to join the program when they are ready to leverage the power of Mixpanel for their product analytics. Once accepted into the program, startups must start sending data to Mixpanel within the first 90 days to maintain eligibility. If a participating startup does not meet the implementation requirement within the first 90 days, they will be removed from the program and prohibited from rejoining. This is not to deter startups from joining, but rather encourage startups to only apply once truly ready. We want you to take full advantage of your year in the program so you can get the most value out of Mixpanel. 

#### What happens if my usage exceeds 1B events?
If you send over 1B events to Mixpanel whilst in the startup program, you will have the option to upgrade to a paid Growth or Enterprise plan, or downgrade to the Free plan. If you are close to exceeding the limit of the Startup Plan, our team will reach out in advance to discuss your options. 

#### Can I continue with the Startup Plan after the first year and receive a second year free?
No. The Mixpanel for Startups program offers eligible companies their first year of Mixpanel for free on the Startup Plan. After the first year, startups are able to move to a Free, Growth, or Enterprise plan. The Startup Plan is only available through the startup program, and cannot be purchased as a standalone plan.

### [Legacy] Credit-Based Program FAQ

If you are in the earlier version of the Mixpanel for Startups program which utilized “startup credits” and have specific questions regarding your account, please reach out to [startups@mixpanel.com](mailto:startups@mixpanel.com). 

#### What is the credit-based startup program?
Prior to September 2024, the Mixpanel for Startups program provided eligible startups with their first year of Mixpanel free, valued up to \$50,000. Startups in this program are able to purchase an annual Growth plan as well as Group Analytics and Data Pipelines add-on packages utilizing credits. 

After acceptance to the program, \$50,000 in credits were added to participants’ Mixpanel account and automatically applied to eligible line items when purchasing an annual [Growth plan](https://mixpanel.com/pricing/#edit-plan) via our plan-builder. The credits cover up to \$50,000 in total usage within the first year. Any additional usage costs in excess of \$50,000 are not covered by the program and will be charged to the credit card on file.

#### Is eligibility different for the credit-based startup program?
No. The startup program – be it the credit or Startup Plan version – have the same eligibility requirements ([outlined above](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/pricing/startup-program#eligibility-criteria)).

#### How do I know if I am in the credit-based startup program?
The credit-based startup program was valid prior to September 4, 2024. If you are currently in this version of the program, \$50,000 worth of credits were added to your account to apply to eligible purchases and upgrades made in your first year. You can see these credits in your Mixpanel account under Organization Settings > Plan Details & Billing.

The Manage Billing & Payment section displays detailed information about the credits that are used to cover your first year of Mixpanel. Eligible credits will also appear in the checkout process when purchasing a Growth plan and premium features through the online plan-builder.

#### Will the startup credits in my account expire?
Yes. The credit-based startup program provides your first year of Mixpanel for free, valued up to \$50,000. After one year, the unused credits expire and are no longer valid. You can see the expiration date in the Credits tab under Plan Details & Billing in the Organization Settings. Once the year elapses, the credits expire and the credit card on file will be charged to cover the subscription renewal and additional data costs.
