## Step 2: Track your first event

You'll need your Project Token for this step, which you can get [here](https://mixpanel.com/settings/project).

<Tabs items={['Javascript', 'Python', 'Node', 'Go', 'Ruby', 'Java', 'React Native', 'Flutter', 'iOS (Objective-C)', 'iOS (Swift)', 'Android', 'Unity']}>

<Tab>

```javascript
// Uncomment if you used npm or yarn in Step 1
//import mixpanel from 'mixpanel-browser';

mixpanel.init(<YOUR_TOKEN>, { debug: true, track_pageview: true, persistence: 'localStorage' });

// Set this to a unique identifier for the user performing the event.
mixpanel.identify(/* \"<USER_ID\"> */)

// Track an event. It can be anything, but in this example, we're tracking a Sign Up event.
mixpanel.track('Sign Up', {
  'Signup Type': 'Referral'
})
```

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you've tracked your first event! You can see it in Mixpanel via the [Events page](https://mixpanel.com/report/events). For more options, see our [JavaScript reference](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript).

You can also follow our video walkthrough [here](https://www.loom.com/embed/fbba03274dc441b49b578e8a734b1d99).

**FAQ**

**Does Mixpanel automatically track page views?**

Yes, if you pass `track_pageview: true` in the `mixpanel.init()` call, Mixpanel will automatically track a "Page View" event every time a new page is loaded. Learn more [here](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript#tracking-page-views).

**Why aren't my events showing up in Mixpanel?**

Make sure you've disabled ad blockers and your Do Not Track (DNT) browser settings are set to false when testing your JavaScript implementation. If the DNT setting is set to true, then Mixpanel won't collect information from that Mixpanel instance.

We recommend [setting up a proxy server](/docs/tracking/how-tos/tracking-via-proxy#how-to-set-up-a-proxy) so that you don't lose events due to ad-blockers.

**Does Mixpanel use third-party cookies?**

No, our Mixpanel JavaScript SDK does not set or use any third-party cookies. If you wish to disable cookies entirely, you can set the disable_persistence option to true when initializing your Mixpanel JS instance. Note that disabling persistence will disable the use of super properties and anonymous -> identified user tracking.

**What are the recommended configuration options?**

We recommend using localStorage instead of cookies for persistence:

```javascript
mixpanel.set_config({ persistence: "localStorage" });
```

This prevents getting a "Cookie Too Large" error and in general is a more reliable way to persist state on the browser.

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you've tracked your first event! You can see it in Mixpanel via the [Events](https://mixpanel.com/report/events) page.

For more options, see the reference and code for each SDK in [Github](https://github.com/mixpanel).

**FAQ**

**Why aren't my events showing up?**
To preserve battery life and customer bandwidth, the Mixpanel library doesn't send the events you record immediately. Instead, it sends batches to the Mixpanel servers every 60 seconds while your application is running, as well as when the application transitions to the background. You can call `.flush()` manually if you want to force a flush at a particular moment for example before your application is completely shutdown. See our [debugging guide](/docs/tracking/how-tos/debugging).

**How do I opt users out of tracking?**
Call the `.optOutTracking()` method, which will prevent data from being sent from the userâ€™s device.

**Starting with iOS 14.5, do I need to request the userâ€™s permission through the AppTrackingTransparency framework to use Mixpanel?**
No, Mixpanel does not use IDFA so it does not require user permission through the AppTrackingTransparency(ATT) framework.

**If I add Mixpanel tracking to my iOS app, how do I answer app privacy questions for the App Store?**
Please refer to our [Apple App Developer Privacy Guidance](https://mixpanel.com/legal/app-store-privacy-details/)

To initialize the library, first open the unity project settings menu for Mixpanel. (Edit -> Project Settings -> Mixpanel) Then, enter your project token into the Token and Debug Token input fields within the inspector. If you prefer to initialize Mixpanel manually, you can select the `Manual Initialization` in the settings and call `Mixpanel.Init()` to initialize.

### HTTP API

If you don't see an SDK or an integration in your language, you can send events to our API directly.

Here's a sample script. Just plug in your Project Token at the top, run the script, and visit our [Events page](https://mixpanel.com/report/events) to see the events in our UI.

```python test.py
# Fill this out
PROJECT_TOKEN = ""  # Get this from mixpanel.com/settings/project

import json
import time
import requests


events = [
    {"event": "my_test_event", "properties": {"time": int(time.time()), "distinct_id": "test_user_1", "$insert_id": "04ce0cf4-a633-4371-b665-9b45317b4976", "city": "San Francisco"}},
    {"event": "another_event", "properties": {"time": int(time.time()), "distinct_id": "test_user_2", "$insert_id": "3b033b9a-6bc9-4b70-90c3-a53e11f6896e", "city": "Seattle"}}
]
resp = requests.post(
    "https://api.mixpanel.com/import",
    params={"strict": "1"},
    auth=(PROJECT_TOKEN, ""),
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
    data=json.dumps(events)
)

print(resp.json())
```

See our [API reference](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/events) for more details.

**Best Practices for Scale**

You can use this API at scale, for example to backfill historical data into Mixpanel or as part of a high-throughput streaming pipeline. We provide walkthroughs for [Amazon S3](/docs/tracking/integrations/s3-import) and [Google Cloud Storage](/docs/tracking/integrations/gcs-import) to provide a more production-grade example of how to use this API at scale.

Here are some other best practices:

- Be explicit about what is tracked to Mixpanel rather than implicitly tracking everything, both for performance and security reasons. Avoid sending user generated content, high-cardinality IDs, or large semi-structured objects.
- Import a more recent time window first (last 7 days or last 30 days) before backfilling historical data. Mixpanel's autocomplete menus populate events and properties based on the last 30 days of data, so this is the best way to test that data looks as expected.
- Leverage batching and compression. Each request to /import can send 2000 events to Mixpanel and can be sent compressed using gzip. The sample code in this guide does both.
- When using Cloud Storage, partition files into ~200MB of JSON (or ~200K records) each. Each file is processed in parallel by Cloud Functions/Lambda and must be ingested by the function within the configured timeout.
- Log any 400 errors returned by the API. These are non-retryable and indicate something malformed with the data. This should be extremely unlikely once the API is up and running. If a batch contains a mix of valid and invalid data, we will ingest the valid data.

**Limits**
Our Import API is built to ingest billions of events per day across our customers. That said, we do rate limit at very high scale to ensure quality of service and real-time ingestion. Please refer to our [Import API docs](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/import-events) for details.

All of our sample code transparently retries and backoff from rate limit exceptions. If you require a higher-limit for a 1-time backfill, please reach out to us at apis@mixpanel.com.

## Step 3: Identify your users

Please refer to our guide on [Identifying Users](/docs/tracking/how-tos/identifying-users) for a detailed walkthrough and example user identity flows.

### Client-side tracking

When using our client-side SDKs (Web or Mobile), Mixpanel will automatically generate a distinct_id value that's local to that user's device. There are only 2 steps:

1. Call `.identify(<user_id>)` when a user signs up or logs in. Pass in the user's known identifier (eg: their ID from your database).
2. Call `.reset()` when a user logs out.

### Server-side tracking

When using our server-side SDKs (Python, Ruby, etc.), user identification is handled by your server which means you will need to generate your own distinct_id value for each event.
