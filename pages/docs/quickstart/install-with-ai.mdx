# Install with AI [BETA]

This guide will help you add Mixpanel analytics to your app or website using AI assistance, even if you're not a developer. The Mixpanel Installation Wizard creates step-by-step instructions that you can give to AI coding tools like Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor.

## What You'll Need

Before starting, make sure you have:

- A Mixpanel account with Admin or Owner access ([sign up](https://www.mixpanel.com/signup) if you don't have one)
- Access to an AI coding assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.)
    - Be sure to use the most advanced AI model you have access to
- Your project's code files and a development or staging environment to test the changes

## Step 1: Get Your Mixpanel Project Token

1. Log into your [Mixpanel account](https://www.mixpanel.com/login)
2. Go to your [project settings](https://www.mixpanel.com/settings/project) (gear icon in the bottom left)
3. Click on "Overview" in the left sidebar
4. Scroll down to Access Keys section and copy your "Project Token" - it looks like a long string of letters and numbers

    (You will need to be an Admin or Owner in your project)

5. Keep this handy - you'll need it in the next step

## Step 2: Create Your AI Instructions

1. Simply paste this command in your terminal:
```
npx @mixpanel/mixpanel-wizard
```
2. Go through and answer a few quick questions and it will then create a customized installation guide

### Choose Your Settings

You'll need to pick three things:

**A. Choose Your SDK Type**

This depends on what type of app or website you're building:

- **`javascript`**
- **`react-native`**
- **`ios-swift`**
- **`ios-objective-c`**
- **`android`**
- **`python`**
- **`nodejs`**
- **`flutter`**
- **`unity`**
- **`go`**
- **`ruby`**
- **`php`**
- **`java`**

*Don't see your platform? Check with a developer or choose the closest match.*

**B. Choose Your Event Type**

This determines what kinds of user actions you'll track:

- **`ai`** - Best for AI-powered features (chatbots, AI tools, ML features)
- **`ecommerce`** - Best for online stores and shopping apps
- **`default`** - Good general-purpose events for most other apps

**C. Decide on Extra Features**

- **Autocapture** - Automatically tracks clicks and page views (JavaScript SDK only)
- **Session Replay** - Records user sessions for debugging (JavaScript, iOS Swift, Android SDKs only)

*Recommendation: Enable both if they're available for your platform*

## Step 3: Give Instructions to Your AI Assistant

1. Open your AI coding tool (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.).
2. Copy over the instruction file generated from the step2 to your project.
3. Make sure it has access to your project files
4. Next, copy and paste this prompt into your AI Agent

```
Let's set up Mixpanel.
1. Set up mixpanel by following the steps in MIXPANEL_INSTALLATION_INSTRUCTIONS.txt. Make sure to follow the global rules specified in the MIXPANEL_INSTALLATION_INSTRUCTIONS.txt.
2. After completing the steps in the installation guide, delete the MIXPANEL_INSTALLATION_INSTRUCTIONS.txt
```

4. Let the AI complete all the steps

The AI will:

- Follow the generated setup instructions
- Install the necessary code
- Set up tracking for your chosen events

## Step 4: Test Your Installation

After the AI completes the setup, test that everything is working:

### Quick Test

1. Deploy the changes to your testing environment
2. Use your app or website normally
3. Go to your Mixpanel dashboard
4. Click on "Events" in the left sidebar or visit the [Events page](https://mixpanel.com/report/events)
5. You should see events flowing in as you use your app (you may need to refresh Mixpanel)

### What to Look For

Depending on your event type, you should see:

**For AI events:**

- "Launch AI" when AI features are used
- "AI Prompt Sent" when users send prompts
- "AI Response Sent" when AI responds

**For E-commerce events:**

- "Product Viewed" when products are viewed
- "Add to Cart" when items are added to cart
- "Purchase" when transactions complete

**For Default events:**

- "Sign Up" for new user registrations
- "Page View" for page visits
- "Search" for search queries

## Troubleshooting

### No Events Showing Up?

1. Check that you used the correct project token
2. Verify your app is running and being used
3. Wait a few minutes - sometimes there's a delay
4. Check the browser console (F12) for any error messages

### Wrong Events Tracking?

1. Make sure you chose the right event type in Step 2B
2. Ask your AI assistant to show you what events are being tracked
3. You can always re-run the setup with different event types

### Need Help?

1. Check the Mixpanel documentation at [docs.mixpanel.com](https://docs.mixpanel.com/)
2. Ask your AI assistant to explain what it installed
3. Contact [Mixpanel support](https://mixpanel.com/contact-us/support/) through our help center

### Success! ðŸŽ‰

Once you see events flowing into your Mixpanel dashboard, you're all set! You can now:

- View real-time user activity
- Create reports and dashboards
- Set up alerts for important events
- Analyze user behavior patterns

The AI has set up all the technical details for you - now you can focus on understanding your users and growing your product.
