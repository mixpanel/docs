# Send Events

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

import ExtendedTabs from '../../../components/ExtendedTabs/ExtendedTabs';
import { dataItems } from '../../../utils/constants';

You can use Mixpanel's SDKs to track events from your website, web application, or backend servers. We [recommend](/docs/tracking-methods/choosing-the-right-method) server-side tracking, since it is more reliable and easier to maintain than web/mobile tracking.

Note: You'll need your Project Token to authenticate, which you can get [here](https://mixpanel.com/settings/project).
