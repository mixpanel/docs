# Track Events

import { Tabs } from "nextra/components";

import ExtendedButton from "/components/ExtendedButton/ExtendedButton";
import ExtendedTabs from "/components/ExtendedTabs/ExtendedTabs";

import { dataItems } from "/utils/constants";

## Overview

This step introduces the `track` method, which allows you to see how your users are using your product.

Use the track method to track events on behalf of your users. Add this code snippet to basic events like "Sign Up" and any additional events that may track the core features of your product.

## Code

ReplaceÂ `Sign Up`Â with a unique identifier for the event. Passing additional information is possible using the properties object.

mixpanel.track('Sign Up', {

})

If you don't see an SDK or an integration in your language, you can send events to our API directly.

Here's a sample script. Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with your project token. You can find your token [here](https://mixpanel.com/settings/project).

```python test.py
# Fill this out
import json
import time
import requests

events = [
    {"event": "my_test_event", "properties": {"time": int(time.time()), "distinct_id": "test_user_1", "$insert_id": "04ce0cf4-a633-4371-b665-9b45317b4976", "city": "San Francisco"}},
    {"event": "another_event", "properties": {"time": int(time.time()), "distinct_id": "test_user_2", "$insert_id": "3b033b9a-6bc9-4b70-90c3-a53e11f6896e", "city": "Seattle"}}
]
resp = requests.post(
    "https://api.mixpanel.com/import",
    params={"strict": "1"},
    auth=("YOUR_TOKEN", ""),
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
    data=json.dumps(events)
)

print(resp.json())
```

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you've tracked your first event! You can see it in Mixpanel via the [Events](https://mixpanel.com/report/events) page.

See our [API reference](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/events) for more details.

**Best Practices for Scale**

You can use this API at scale, for example to backfill historical data into Mixpanel or as part of a high-throughput streaming pipeline. We provide walkthroughs for [Amazon S3](/docs/data-pipelines/integrations/amazon-s3) and [Google Cloud Storage](/docs/data-pipelines/integrations/google-cloud-storage) to provide a more production-grade example of how to use this API at scale.

Here are some other best practices:

- Be explicit about what is tracked to Mixpanel rather than implicitly tracking everything, both for performance and security reasons. Avoid sending user generated content, high-cardinality IDs, or large semi-structured objects.
- Import a more recent time window first (last 7 days or last 30 days) before backfilling historical data. Mixpanel's autocomplete menus populate events and properties based on the last 30 days of data, so this is the best way to test that data looks as expected.
- Leverage batching and compression. Each request to /import can send 2000 events to Mixpanel and can be sent compressed using gzip. The sample code in this guide does both.
- When using Cloud Storage, partition files into ~200MB of JSON (or ~200K records) each. Each file is processed in parallel by Cloud Functions/Lambda and must be ingested by the function within the configured timeout.
- Log any 400 errors returned by the API. These are non-retryable and indicate something malformed with the data. This should be extremely unlikely once the API is up and running. If a batch contains a mix of valid and invalid data, we will ingest the valid data.

**Limits**

Our Import API is built to ingest billions of events per day across our customers. That said, we do rate limit at very high scale to ensure quality of service and real-time ingestion. Please refer to our [Import API docs](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/import-events) for details.

All of our sample code transparently retries and backoff from rate limit exceptions. If you require a higher-limit for a 1-time backfill, please reach out to us at apis@mixpanel.com.

## FAQ

  return (
    <details
      open={false}
      className="last-of-type:mb-0 rounded-xl bg-[#f5f2f2] p-0 mt-6"

  );
}

<div className="faqComponent" >

<FAQBox title="Does Mixpanel automatically track page views?">
  Yes, if you pass `track_pageview: true` in the `mixpanel.init()` call,
  Mixpanel will automatically track a "Page View" event every time a new page is
  loaded. Learn more
  [here](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript#tracking-page-views).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Why aren't my events showing up?">
  If tracking from the web, make sure you've disabled ad blockers and your Do Not Track (DNT) 
  browser settings are set to false when testing your JavaScript implementation. If 
  the DNT setting is set to true, then Mixpanel won't collect information from that Mixpanel 
  instance. We also recommend [setting up a proxy server](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript#tracking-via-proxy) 
  so that you don't lose events due to ad-blockers.

If tracking from a mobile device, events may take 1-2 minutes to appear because Mixpanel's
mobile SDKs buffer events for 1 minute, or when the app transitions to the background, to
conserve battery life and bandwidth. You can call `.flush()` in the mobile SDKs to manually flush events to Mixpanel.
