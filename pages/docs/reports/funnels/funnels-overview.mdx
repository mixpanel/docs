# Funnels: Measure conversions through a series of events

## Overview

![/funnels_result_header.png](/funnels_result_header.png)

Mixpanel's Funnels allows you to examine how end-users perform events in a series. Funnels calculate and display conversions from one event to another within a particular time window. This allows you to identify where your users drop off, what segments convert the most, and other important facets of the user journey.

Get started with the [Quick Start guide](/docs/reports/funnels/funnels-quickstart).

## Use Cases

Imagine your product is a B2B messaging application. You might use Funnels to answer these questions:

- What percent of users converted through my signup funnel within 7 days?
- At what step of the signup funnel did most users drop off?
- How did my A/B test impact conversions in the signup funnel?
- How has the payment funnel conversion rate in the US changed over time?
- How long does it take most users to complete my payment funnel?
- What departments complete the payment funnel most often?
- Why did the successful users purchase?
