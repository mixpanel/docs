A funnel is a sequence of events done within a defined period of time. A converted user is one who triggers the funnel events, in the specified order, within the defined time period.

## Step 1: Define your Funnel Behavior

A funnel is the basic building block of the Funnels report. A funnel is a sequence of events done within a defined period of time.

For example,  let's say your signup flow contains five steps. Within the funnel definition, you can add one event for each step, in the following order: “Landing Page” -> “Download Page” -> “App Install” -> “App Open” -> “Sign Up.” At this point, your query should look like this.

## Step 2: Choose your Measurement

After your funnel is defined, you can choose how you want to measure the funnel. By default, the Funnels report will select the unique conversion rate of the funnel as the measurement.

## Step 3: Choose Filters

In this case, we only care about events performed on the iOS platform. Therefore, add a “Platform” filter, where Platform equals “iOS Native”. At this point, your query should look like this.

## Step 4: Choose Breakdowns

Breakdowns segment data into groups. In this case, we want to break our funnel down by marketing medium, tracked via UTM tags. Therefore, you can add a “UTM Medium” breakdown.

## Step 5: Choose Visualization

You can visualize your metric in a variety of ways. Mixpanel allows you to choose how you would like to visualize your data. Select “Funnel Steps” in the top right to change your visualization. In Funnels, you can choose:

- Funnel Steps - see how users are progressing through the funnel
- Line - see how your metric is trending over time
- Bar - see a summary view of your metric
- Metric - see a summary view of your metric
