While analyzing customer journeys using Mixpanel's analytics, you can identify **where** customers drop off. Now, with Mixpanel Session Replay, you can quickly follow up by exploring **why** customers drop off.

## Watching Replays

<Callout type="info">
By default, user replays are stored for 30 days after the time of ingestion. Customers on our Enterprise plan can customize this retention period. Once a replay is expired, there is no way to view that replay.
</Callout>

Replays can be viewed in three places:

1. From the User Profile page
2. From Mixpanel reports
3. On the Home page for your project

### From User Profile page

In any user's profile page, Click the "View Replays" button to watch replays from that user. From here, you will be taken to our Replay Player.

The Replay Feed on the left of the player also allows you to:

- See a feed of events that occurred during each replay

## FAQ

#### What happens when I reach my Session Replay limit?
Customers who have purchased the Session Replay add-on will be billed for replays ingested beyond the purchased amount at the ala carte rate. Customers using Session Replay without purchasing the add-on (e.g., those using complimentary replays included with the Free, Growth, or Enterprise plans) will be unable to view replays once they reach the data allowance, unless they upgrade. We will send email notifications to [organization Owners and Billing Admins](/docs/orgs-and-projects/roles-and-permissions#organization-roles) as your projects approaches the data allowance of your subscription plan.

Mixpanel reserves the right to stop ingesting replays once a customer collects replays beyond their purchased/allocated amount. To minimize disruption to your team, we recommend monitoring your data usage in the organization settings and working with your Account Manager (if applicable) to ensure you have the right plan for your needs.

#### How soon are Replays available for viewing after a session begins?

Replays are available for viewing in Mixpanel ~1 minute after the recording is captured.

#### How long are replays stored?

By default, user replays are stored for 30 days after the time of ingestion. Customers on our Enterprise plan can customize this retention period between 7 days and 360 days. Once a replay is expired, there is no way to view that replay.

#### Why does it say the player failed to load?

To maintain a high level of security, Mixpanel runs your session replays in an isolated domain through an iframe. Occasionally, this domain may be blocked by an ad blocker or specific browser settings. We recommend disabling any ad blockers, or whitelisting the Mixpanel domain.

For extensions like uBlock, go to "My Filters" in the extension settings and add the following custom filter:

```
@@||mxpnl.com^$domain=mxpnl.com
```

#### Why can't I see the "View Replays" button in the UI?

You will not see the "View Replays" button if your organization is on an older plan. You will need to update to the latest plan to use Session Replay (see [here](/docs/session-replay#plan-availability) for details).

#### Can I use Session Replay with a CDP?

You can use Session Replay with CDPs (e.g., Segment and mParticle) for the web platform. Your app must include the Mixpanel Javascript SDK, with Session Replay enabled. Learn more in the developer guide [here](/docs/session-replay/implement-session-replay/session-replay-web#session-replay-with-a-cdp).

#### How can I estimate how many Replays I will generate?

If you already use Mixpanel, the [Session Start events](/docs/features/sessions) are a way to estimate the rough amount of replays you might expect. This is especially true if you use timeout-based query sessions. However, because our sessions are defined at query time, we cannot guarantee these metrics will be directly correlated.

When you enable Session Replay, use the above proxy metric to determine a starting sampling percentage, which will determine how many replays will be sent. You can always adjust this as you go to calibrate to the right level.

#### Am I able to sample our Session Replay collection rate?

Yes, you can configure the percentage of total replays that our SDK will capture as a sampling rate or manually trigger/end replay capture. See the developers guide for [implementing Session Replay](/docs/session-replay/implement-session-replay) to learn more about sampling and manual capture.
