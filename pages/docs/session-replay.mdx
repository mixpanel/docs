# Session Replay: Watch playbacks of user digital experiences

Mixpanel Session Replay provides the fastest way to gain a comprehensive understanding of your customers and make informed product decisions by combining both quantitative and qualitative insights.

While analyzing customer journeys using Mixpanel's analytics, you can identify **where** customers drop off. Now, with Mixpanel Session Replay, you can quickly follow up by exploring **why** customers drop off.

## Plan Availability

Session Replay is available for customers on Free, Growth, and Enterprise plans:

| Plan       | Replay Allowance                                                         |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Free       | 10k free Replays per month                                               |
| Growth     | 20k free Replays per month                                               |
| Enterprise | 20k free Replays per month ([additional Replays available as an add-on](https://mixpanel.com/pricing/))|

Customers must be on the latest Mixpanel plans to access free replays.

- For customers on an existing **Free** plan:
    - Switch your plan to the latest Free plan, which includes 1M monthly events and 10k session replays. You can make this switch directly from the [pricing page](https://mixpanel.com/pricing/).
- For customers on an existing **Growth** plan:
    - You're on the latest plan if you purchased or edited your plan after April 2024. If you are not sure if your organization is using the latest plan, you confirm on the pricing page - if you see "Make the Switch" on the Growth plan, then you are on an older version.
    - You can make the switch to our latest plan directly from the [pricing page](https://mixpanel.com/pricing/).
- Enterprise customers should contact their Account Manager to determine their plan status.

## Watching Replays

<Callout type="info">
User replays are stored for 30 days after the time of ingestion. There is no way to view a replay older than 30 days old.
</Callout>

Replays can be viewed in three places:

1. From the User Profile page
2. From Mixpanel reports
3. On the Home page for your project

### From User Profile page

In any user's profile page, Click the "View Replays" button to watch replays from that user. From here, you will be taken to our Replay Player.

![replayProfileEntry](/replayProfileEntryPoint.png)

### From Mixpanel reports

<Callout type="info">
  Reports entry point is currently supported for Event, Funnel, and User Profile metrics only.
</Callout>

Click any point on a chart for Event, Funnel, and User Profile, and select "View Replays" to view replays that show that event being fired. From here, you will be taken to our Replay Player. 

![replayReportEntry](/replayReportEntryPoint.png)

### From the Home page

Find the Latest Replays card and click on individual replays to view them or click on "View All Replays" to see up to 100 of your latest replays.

![replayHomeEntry](/replayHomeEntryPoint.png)

### Replay Player

![replayHeroImageWithPrivacy](/replayHeroImageWithPrivacy.png)

The Replay Player allows you to watch replays, as well as:

- Expand the player to full-screen
- Copy a URL with or without a timestamp to share with your teammates
- Change the playback speed
- Automatically skip periods of the replay where user is inactive
- See events in the replay timeline
- Jump to different parts of the replay by clicking in the timeline

The Replay Feed on the left of the player also allows you to:

- Sort replays by recency, activity, or duration
- Search for replays by user's name / email, replay date, user ID, or the name of an event in the replay
- See a feed of events that occurred during each replay

## Heatmaps (Beta)

<Callout type="info">
  Heatmaps are currently in private, closed beta. For early access, please contact your Account Manager.
</Callout>

Heatmaps help you visualize user interactions on your web application, showing where users click the most. This feature enables teams to quickly identify areas of high engagement and friction, helping to optimize user experiences and improve conversion rates.

Our initial version of Heatmaps is a click map, which means it specifically tracks clicks on individual site elements rather than just overlaying general activity on a page. This provides more precise insights into which modals, dropdowns, or features that users engage with the most. Future versions may also include hovers, scroll depth, and other interaction types.

Enabling Heatmaps does not affect billing. They are included with the Session Replay add-on and do not generate additional billable events.

###  How It Works
Heatmaps are powered by Session Replay data and automatically capture click interactions when enabled. Users can generate a Heatmap for specific pages to gain deeper insights into user engagement.

To function, Heatmaps require Session Replay to be enabled, as they rely on session replay data to track and visualize user clicks.

Heatmaps only capture data during sessions with recorded replays. If a page has limited replay coverage, the Heatmap may not offer meaningful insights.

### Implementation
Ensure you have Session Replay set up, and click interaction tracking enabled. Session Replays are required for Heatmaps to work.

If you currently use [Autocapture](/docs/tracking-methods/autocapture) to track clicks, you can leverage these clicks to populate the Heatmaps.

### Using Heatmaps
1. From the Home page, find the Heatmaps section
2. Choose a URL where you want to analyze user interactions.
3. To easily navigate back to a created Heatmap, you can click the title to rename the Heatmap

## Server Side Stitching

Server-Side Stitching allows you to easily watch replays for events that are not fired from our SDK. It works by inferring the replay an event happened in by looking at the distinct ID and time that the replay occurred. This is especially useful if you have events coming in from multiple sources such as your server or via warehouse import where it does not make sense to pass around the value of `mixpanel.get_session_recording_properties()`. (Note: we still recommend including these properties on your client side events to guarantee accuracy.)

This make it possible to watch replays for events tracked server-side, events coming from your data warehouse, and events tracked with your CDP (we still recommend using our [CDP middleware](/docs/session-replay-web#can-i-use-session-replay-with-a-cdp) to ensure data accuracy for cross tab/platform user sessions).

| | **With Competitors** | **With Mixpanel** | **Value Add** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Events sent via Data Warehouses** | Cannot watch replays that contain without lots of custom code | Can easily watch replays that contain, just need our SDK to capture replays and make an `.identify()` call | **High** |
| **Events sent via APIs (e.g. server-side events)** | Cannot watch replays that contain without lots of custom code | Can easily watch replays that contain, just need our SDK to capture replays and make an `.identify()` call | **High** |
| **Events sent via Customer Data Platform** | Middleware required to watch replays that contain a specific event | You do not need middleware to watch replays that contain specific events. However, we recommend adding middleware to handle edge cases where replays may not be associated with the right events (simultaneous sessions across tabs, domains, or apps) | **Medium** |
| **Events sent via Client-Side SDK** | Can easily watch replays that contain a specific event | Can easily watch replays that contain a specific event | **Low** |

To ensure Server-Side Stitching works, call `identify()` from the client-side using our SDK with the user's unique Distinct ID. This guarantees that events generated from both the client-side and server-side share the same Distinct ID.

## FAQ

#### What happens when I reach my Session Replay limit?
Customers who have purchased the Session Replay add-on will be billed for replays ingested beyond the purchased amount at the ala carte rate. We will send email notifications to [organization Owners and Billing Admins](/docs/orgs-and-projects/roles-and-permissions#organization-roles) as your projects approaches the data allowance of your subscription plan.

Customers using Session Replay without purchasing the add-on (e.g., those using complimentary replays included with the Free, Growth, or Enterprise plans) will be unable to view replays once they reach the data allowance, unless they upgrade. We will send email notifications to [organization Owners and Billing Admins](/docs/orgs-and-projects/roles-and-permissions#organization-roles) as your projects approaches the data allowance of your subscription plan.

Mixpanel reserves the right to stop ingesting replays once a customer collects replays beyond their purchased/allocated amount. To minimize disruption to your team, we recommend monitoring your data usage in the organization settings and working with your Account Manager (if applicable) to ensure you have the right plan for your needs.

#### How soon are Replays available for viewing after a session begins?

Replays are available for viewing in Mixpanel ~1 minute after the recording is captured.

#### How long are replays stored?

Replays are stored for 30 days.

#### Why does it say the player failed to load?

To maintain a high level of security, Mixpanel runs your session replays in an isolated domain through an iframe. Occasionally, this domain may be blocked by an ad blocker or specific browser settings. We recommend disabling any ad blockers, or whitelisting the Mixpanel domain.

For extensions like uBlock, go to "My Filters" in the extension settings and add the following custom filter:

```
@@||mxpnl.com^$domain=mxpnl.com
```

#### Why can't I see the "View Replays" button in the UI?

You will not see the "View Replays" button if your organization is on an older plan. You will need to update to the latest plan to use Session Replay (see [here](/docs/session-replay#plan-availability) for details).

#### Can I use Session Replay with a CDP?

You can use Session Replay with CDPs (e.g., Segment and mParticle) for the web platform. Your app must include the Mixpanel Javascript SDK, with Session Replay enabled. Learn more in the developer guide [here](/docs/session-replay/implement-session-replay/session-replay-web#session-replay-with-a-cdp).

#### How can I estimate how many Replays I will generate?

If you already use Mixpanel, the [Session Start events](/docs/features/sessions) are a way to estimate the rough amount of replays you might expect. This is especially true if you use timeout-based query sessions. However, because our sessions are defined at query time, we cannot guarantee these metrics will be directly correlated.

When you enable Session Replay, use the above proxy metric to determine a starting sampling percentage, which will determine how many replays will be sent. You can always adjust this as you go to calibrate to the right level.

#### Am I able to sample our Session Replay collection rate?

Yes, you can configure the percentage of total replays that our SDK will capture as a sampling rate or manually trigger/end replay capture. See the developers guide for [implementing Session Replay](/docs/session-replay/implement-session-replay) to learn more about sampling and manual capture.
