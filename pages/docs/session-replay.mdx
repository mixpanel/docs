# Session Replay

Mixpanel Session Replay is the fastest way to understand the whole picture about your customers and make better product decisions, by combining quantitative and qualitative user insights. 

When digging into customer journeys in Mixpanel’s analytics, you can understand “**where** do customers drop-off?” And now, Mixpanel Session Replay enables you to quickly follow-up with, “**why** do customers drop off?”

## Platform Availability

We currently support two platforms:

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card icon title="Web" href="/docs/session-replay/session-replay-web" />
  <Cards.Card icon title="iOS (Beta)" href="/docs/session-replay/session-replay-ios" />
</Cards>

## Implementation
Session Replay is not enabled by default; enabling the feature requires instrumentation beyond the standard Mixpanel instrumentation. However, in most cases, implementation is extremely simple, only requiring a single line of code to be changed.

- Our documentation on how to implement Session Replay with our Javascript SDK can be found [here](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript#session-replay)
- Our documentation on how to implement Session Replay with CDPs (like Segment and mParticle) can be found [here](/docs/session-replay/session-replay-web#can-i-use-session-replay-with-a-cdp).

Replays sent via your implementation will only be viewable in the project they were ingested in and will not be available to other projects in your org.

Before you enable Session Replay for a large audience, we recommend testing in a demo project, and starting in production with smaller sets of users or accounts, so that you can monitor performance and ensure your privacy rules align with company policies.

## Plan Availability

Session Replay is available for customers on Free, Growth, and Enterprise plans:
- Customers on the Free plan have access to 10k free replays per month.
- Customers on the Growth and Enterprise plans have access to 20k free replays per month.
- Additional custom volumes of Session Replay are available as an add-on purchase for [Enterprise plans](https://mixpanel.com/pricing/).

To access free replays, customers will need to ensure they’re on the latest Mixpanel plans:

- For customers on an existing **Free** plan:
    - Switch your plan to the latest Free plan, which includes 1M monthly events and 10k session replays. You can make this switch directly from the [pricing page](https://mixpanel.com/pricing/).
- For customers on an existing **Growth** plan:
    - You're on the latest plan if you purchased or edited your plan after April 2024. If you’re not sure if you’re on the latest plan, you confirm on the pricing page - if you see ‘Make the Switch’ on the Growth plan, then you are on an older version.
    - You can make the switch to our latest plan directly from the [pricing page](https://mixpanel.com/pricing/).
- Enterprise customers should contact their account manager to determine their plan status.

Customers who purchase the Session Replay add-on will be charged overages for any replays ingested beyond their purchased limit. To avoid disruptions, please monitor your usage regularly. For customers with complimentary Session Replays (whether through a sales discount, an included plan benefit, or our Startup Program), any replays exceeding the monthly or annual limit will first be hidden behind a paywall, and eventually be dropped. Replay usage is aggregated across all projects within your billing account.

## Using Session Replay

Session Replay can be accessed in three places:

1. From User Profile page
2. From Mixpanel reports
3. On the Home page for your project

### From User Profile page

In any user’s profile page, Click the ‘View Replays’ button to watch replays from that user. From here, you will be taken to our Replay Player.

![replayProfileEntry](/replayProfileEntryPoint.png)

### From Mixpanel reports

Click any point on a chart for Event, Funnel, and User Profile, and select ‘View Replays’ to view replays that show that event being fired. From here, you will be taken to our Replay Player. 

![replayReportEntry](/replayReportEntryPoint.png)

*Note: reports entry point is currently supported for Event, Funnel, and User Profile metrics only.*

### From the Home page

Find the Latest Replays card and click on individual replays to view them or click on ‘View All Replays‘ to see up to 100 of your latest replays.

### Replay Player

![replayHeroImageWithPrivacy](/replayHeroImageWithPrivacy.png)

The Replay Player allows you to watch replays, as well as:

- Expand the player to full-screen
- Copy a URL with or without a timestamp to share with your teammates
- Change the playback speed
- Automatically skip periods of the replay where user is inactive
- See events in the replay timeline
- Jump to different parts of the replay by clicking in the timeline

The Replay Feed on the left of the player also allows you to:

- Sort replays by recency, activity, or duration
- Search for replays by user's name / email, replay date, user ID, or the name of an event in the replay
- See a feed of events that occurred during each replay

## Heatmaps (Beta)
Heatmaps in Mixpanel help you visualize user interactions on your web application, showing where users click the most. This feature enables teams to quickly identify areas of high engagement and friction, helping to optimize user experiences and improve conversion rates.

Our initial version of heatmaps is a click map, which means it specifically tracks clicks on individual site elements rather than just overlaying general activity on a page. This provides more precise insights into which modals, dropdowns, or features that users engage with the most.

Heatmaps are currently in private, closed beta. For early access, please contact your Account Manager.

###  How It Works
Heatmaps are powered by session replay data and automatically capture click interactions when enabled. Users can generate heatmaps for specific pages to get deeper insights into user engagement.

### Implementation
Ensure you have Session Replay set up, and click interaction tracking enabled. Session Replays are required for Heatmaps to work. 

Note: if you already utilize Mixpanel's [autocapture functionality](/docs/tracking-methods/autocapture) to capture clicks, then these clicks can be used to populate Heatmaps

### Using Heatmaps
1. From the Home page, find the Heatmaps section
2. Choose a URL where you want to analyze user interactions.
3. To easily navigate back to a created Heatmap, you can click the title to rename the Heatmap

### Additional Notes
- Session Replay must be enabled for heatmaps to work, as heatmaps rely on session replay data to track and visualize user clicks. 
- Enabling heatmaps does not impact billing. They’re included as part of the Session Replay add-on and do not generate additional billable events.
- Heatmaps only capture data during sessions where replays are recorded. If a page has limited replay coverage, the heatmap may not be meaningful.
- Currently, heatmaps track click interactions. Future versions may also include hovers, scroll depth, and other interaction types.

## Server Side Stitching

Server-Side Stitching allows our customers to easily watch replays for events that aren’t fired from our SDK. 

It works by inferring the replay an event happened in by looking at the distinct ID and time that the replay occurred. This is especially useful if you have events coming in from multiple sources, like your server or via warehouse import and it doesn't make sense to pass around the value of `mixpanel.get_session_recording_properties()`. NOTE: we still recommend including these properties on your client side events to guarantee accuracy.

As a result, this feature:
- makes it 10x easier to watch replays for events coming from your data warehouse
- makes it 10x easier to watch replays for server-side tracked events
- makes Session Replay work automatically with events tracked with your CDP *(although we still recommend using our [CDP middleware](/docs/session-replay-web#can-i-use-session-replay-with-a-cdp) to ensure data accuracy for cross tab / platform user sessions)*

| | **With Competitors** | **With Mixpanel** | **Value Add** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Events sent via Data Warehouses** | Can’t watch replays that contain without lots of custom code | Can easily watch replays that contain, just need our SDK to capture replays and make an `.identify()` call | **High** |
| **Events sent via APIs (e.g. server-side events)** | Can’t watch replays that contain without lots of custom code | Can easily watch replays that contain, just need our SDK to capture replays and make an `.identify()` call | **High** |
| **Events sent via Customer Data Platform** | Middleware required to watch replays that contain a specific event | You don’t need middleware to watch replays that contain specific events. However, we recommend adding middleware to handle edge cases where replays may not be associated with the right events (simultaneous sessions across tabs, domains, or apps) | **Medium** |
| **Events sent via Client-Side SDK** | Can easily watch replays that contain a specific event | Can easily watch replays that contain a specific event | **Low** |

In order for Server Side Stitching to work, just ensure that the Mixpanel Javascript SDK calls `identify()` at some point with the user's unique Distinct ID. [See managing user identity](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript#managing-user-identity).

## FAQ

### What happens when I reach my Session Replay limit?
For customers who have purchased our Session Replay add-on, you will be billed for replays ingested beyond your purchased amount at the per unit rate. Before this happens, we'll send email notifications warning that your limit is approaching to users with  “Owner” or “Billing Admin” permissions over your Mixpanel organization.

For customers using Session Replay who have not purchased our add-on (for example, using complimentary replays included with your Free, Growth, or Enterprise plan), replays above your complimentary amount will not be viewable until you upgrade your plan. Before this happens, users with  “Owner” or “Billing Admin” permissions over your Mixpanel organization will be notified that their limit is approaching.

Mixpanel reserves the right to stop ingesting replays once a customer collects replays beyond their purchased / allocated amount. To minimize disruption to your team, we recommend monitoring your usage in Mixpanel’s user interface and, if applicable to your  account, working with your Account Manager to ensure you have the right plan for your session replay needs.

### How soon are Replays available for viewing after a session begins?

There is about a ~1 minute delay between when recordings are captured and when they appear in Mixpanel.
