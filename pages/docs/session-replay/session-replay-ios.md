- And set the framework's Embed setting to "Embed & Sign" in the "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section

## Initialize

You should have the main Mixpanel SDK installed, if not, please refer to [Prerequisite](#prerequisite) Add the initialization code at the start of your app's lifecycle.

SwiftUI

```swift
import Mixpanel
import MixpanelSessionReplay

struct SessionReplayDemoApp: App {
    @State private var isActive = true
    @Environment(\.scenePhase) private var scenePhase

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ...
        }
        .onChange(of: scenePhase) { _, newPhase in
            let config = SessionReplayConfig(wifiOnly: false, recordSessionsPercent: 100.0)
            let sessionReplayInstance = SessionReplay.initialize(token: "MY_TOKEN", distinctId: "distinctId", config: config)
            #if DEBUG
            sessionReplayInstance.loggingEnabled = true
            #endif
            sessionReplayInstance.startRecording()
        }
    }
}

```

UIKit

```swift
import Foundation
import UIKit

import Mixpanel
import MixpanelSessionReplay

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
        Mixpanel.initialize(token: token, trackAutomaticEvents: true)
        Mixpanel.mainInstance().loggingEnabled = true

        return true
    }

    func applicationDidBecomeActive(_ application: UIApplication) {
        let config = SessionReplayConfig(wifiOnly: false, recordSessionsPercent: 100.0)
        let sessionReplayInstance = SessionReplay.initialize(token: "MY_TOKEN", distinctId: "distinctId", config: config)
        #if DEBUG
        sessionReplayInstance.loggingEnabled = true
        #endif
        sessionReplayInstance.startRecording()
    }

}

```

## Configuration Options

### Session Replay Config

Upon initialization you can provide a SessionReplayConfig object to specify the configuration. Currently, there are only two config options:

`wifiOnly` - when set to `true` replay events will only be flushed to the server when the device has a WiFi connection, if there is no WiFi, flushes are skipped and the events remain in the in-memory queue until WiFi is restored (or until the queue reaches its limit and the oldest events are evicted to make room for newer events). When set to `false` replay events will be flushed with any network connection, including cellular. - Default: `true`

`recordSessionsPercent` - this is a value between 0.0 and 100.0 that controls the sampling rate for recording session replays, at 0.0 no sessions will be recorded, at 100.0 all sessions will be recorded. - Default: 0.0

`maskAllText` - which allows users to determine whether all text elements in the session replay should be masked. By default, this option is enabled (`true`)

`maskAllImages` - to control whether all images in the session replay should be masked. This option is also enabled by default (`true`)

### Logging

Developers can enable or disable logging with the `loggingEnabled` property of the `SessionReplay` object.

### Example

```swift
let token = Mixpanel.mainInstance().apiToken
let distinctId = Mixpanel.mainInstance().distinctId
let config = SessionReplayConfig(wifiOnly: false, recordSessionsPercent: 50.0)
let sessionReplayInstance = SessionReplay.initialize(token: token, distinctId: distinctId, config: config)
sessionReplayInstance.loggingEnabled = true

```

## Enable Session Replay

To start the session replay recording, you only need to call this once so we recommend calling this at the beginning of your app’s lifecycle:

```swift
SessionReplay.getInstance()?.startRecording()

```

To stop the session replay recording:

```swift
SessionReplay.getInstance()?.stopRecording()
```

## Privacy Settings

By default, Mixpanel will hide UILabel and UITextField to exclude more sensitive views from recording, to mark any view as sensitive:

```swift
// SwiftUI
Image("family photo")
	.replaySensitive()

// UIKit
SessionReplay.getInstance()?.addSensitiveView(mySensitiveView)

```

## FAQ

### How does Session Replay work in iOS?

Session Replay observes user interactions within your app, capturing UI hierarchy changes and storing them as images, which are then sent to Mixpanel. Mixpanel reconstructs these images, applying recorded events as an end-user completes them. Within Mixpanel’s platform, you can view a reconstruction of your end-user’s screen as they navigate your app. However, Session Replay is not a literal video recording of your end-user’s screen; end-user actions are not video-recorded.

### What is the expected impact on my app performance?

There is no impact on your app’s performance when there are no user interactions or nothing changes on the screen. When there are user interactions, expect approximately 1% to 3% more CPU usage and around 1MB more memory consumption. There is no impact on disk I/O because Session Replay does not write anything to your disk. In our own testing, the overhead is unnoticeable, however if you experience any performance degradations after installing Session Replay, please reach out to us.

### What is the bandwidth impact and will it cause users to incur additional data charges?

The bandwidth impact of Session Replay depends on the setting of the `wifiOnly` parameter.

When `wifiOnly` is set to `true` (default setting), replay events are only flushed to the server when the device has a WiFi connection. If there is no WiFi, flushes are skipped, and the events remain in the in-memory queue until WiFi is restored. This ensures no additional cellular data is used, preventing users from incurring additional data charges.

When `wifiOnly` is set to `false`, replay events are flushed with any available network connection, including cellular. In this case, the amount of cellular data consumed depends on the intensity of user interactions and the typical session length of your app. Users may incur additional data charges if large amounts of data are transmitted over cellular connections.

### How does Session Replay for mobile work if my app is offline?

Session Replay for mobile currently doesn’t work in offline mode.

### Am I able to sample our session replay collection rate?

Yes, you can configure the percentage of total replays that our SDK will capture as below.

```swift
let config = SessionReplayConfig(wifiOnly: false, recordSessionsPercent: 50.0)
let sessionReplayInstance = SessionReplay.initialize(token: token, distinctId: distinctId, config: config)
```

This out-of-the-box sampling method is random sampling: your SDK will decide randomly whether the currently SDK instance load falls into the sample or not. We recommend starting at 1% and increasing from there. Please note: if you expect low traffic, you can increase the starting sampling percentage. It is a good idea to control this with your own API, so you can change it on the fly without redeploying your app. While you're testing, we recommend that you set it to 100 and this ensure every user session will be sent to Mixpanel. Once testing is done, we recommend lowering this value in production.

### Does it work in SwiftUI/UIKit apps?\*\*

Yes, please refer to this [section](#initialize)

### Does it support Obj-C based app?

Yes, Objective-C and Swift are fully interoperable.

### Can I prevent Session Replay from recording sensitive content?

If your app is UIKit-based, all `UITextField` and `UILabel` components are masked by default, and there is no way to unmask them. You can also mask any view manually by calling:

```swift
// UIKit
SessionReplay.getInstance()?.addSensitiveView(mySensitiveView);
```

If your app is SwiftUI-based, the automatic masking for `UITextField` and `UILabel` does not work well in the current alpha version, so you need to manually mask any view.

```swift
Image("family photo").replaySensitive();
```
