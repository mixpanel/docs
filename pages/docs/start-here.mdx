## Concepts

Before you start set up, you should know the 3 key concepts that power Mixpanel:

- **Events** are actions that happen in your product
- **Users** are the people who use your product
- **Properties** are the attributes of your users and events

To set up Mixpanel successfully, you need to understand how these concepts work together - and plan your first implementation accordingly.

### Events
An event is a data point that represents an interaction between a user and your product. Events can be a wide range of interactions. 

Imagine you run a cafe where customers can purchases a coffee via an app. Each purchase is an event that can be tracked in Mixpanel.

### Users
On the other side of an event is a user â€” the specific individual who completed an interaction with your product.

Because each user is unique, Mixpanel tracks which users completed what events and marries the two distinct data points by joining them. `event.distinct_id = user_profile.distinct_id`

### Properties
You can track additional information about **users** and **events**. These details are called **properties**.

An **Event Property** describes an event. For a coffee purchase, the event would be *Purchased Item* and the event properties could be *type* (in this case a Coffee) and *price* (in this case $2.50).

A **User Property** describes a User. This could be their name, email, age, etc.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics, **we recommend planning the first events you would like to track**. This will help you understand what you need to get started.

Choosing these events should take no more than 5 minutes.
