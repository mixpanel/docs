# Choosing the right method

If you use our SDKs, there are two general approaches to track events: client-side and server-side. The approach you choose has implications on the quality and comprehensiveness of your data.

We recommend tracking everything you possibly can via your servers, and only supplementing that with client-side tracking when necessary.

Note: If you already track events via a CDP, Tag Manager, or via your DWH using something like Snowplow, you can route those events to Mixpanel with our native integrations. See the [Segment](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-mixpanel/), [Rudderstack](https://rudderstack.com/integration/mixpanel/), or [GTM](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-gtm-template#readme) docs for a walkthrough. We can also load data directly from data warehouses like [Snowflake](/docs/tracking/integrations/snowflake) and [BigQuery](/docs/tracking/integrations/snowflake).

## Client-Side Tracking

In this method, events are generated on the client device and sent to the Mixpanel API. There are two types of client-side tracking: web (Javascript) and mobile.

**Pros**

- Easy to track client-side actions and state
- Easy to track anonymous (non-logged in) user data

**Cons**

- Unreliable, due to ad-blockers. You may lose events for 30-50% of your users. You can resolve this by sending events through a proxy, but it requires a bit more effort
- Difficult to keep metrics consistent across web, iOS, and Android since each requires its own tracking
- Difficult to fix integration mistakes quickly (particularly on mobile applications)
- Tracking will diverge over time due to old mobile clients

## Server-Side Tracking

In this method, you send events from your servers to Mixpanel. For example, when a user loads a web page, a request is made to your web application server. In the code that handles the request, you can create a "Page Loaded" event and send it to Mixpanel. You can use one of our server SDKs (eg: Python) or send events to our HTTP API directly.

**Pros**

- Reliable, not susceptible to ad-blockers
- Data is consistent across platforms
- Easier to fix integration mistakes quickly

**Cons**

- Harder to track user interactions that only happen on the client
- Requires some custom code to track anonymous (non-logged in) users across requests

## Client-Side Tracking via a Proxy
A proxy is helpful in a client-side web setting to reduce the likelihood of ad-blockers impacting your tracking. Please see [this article](sdks/javascript.md#tracking-via-proxy) on how to set up a proxy.
