# Mixpanel Data Inspector

## Overview

The Mixpanel Data Inspector is a browser extension that provides real-time visibility into events being sent to Mixpanel from your web application. This tool helps developers and analysts validate tracking implementation, debug data issues, and ensure data quality during development and testing.

## Key Features

**View SDK Events**
- Monitor events sent from the Mixpanel SDK in real-time
- See events as they're transmitted to Mixpanel servers
- Track both successful and failed event calls

**JSON Payload Inspection**
- View complete JSON payload for each event
- Copy JSON payload to clipboard for analysis
- Examine event structure and data formatting

**Event and Property Search**
- Search through event payloads to find specific properties
- Filter away noisy events to find desired information efficiently
- Inspect registered super properties and other event metadata

## Installation

## Usage

### Getting Started
1. **Install the extension** from your browser's extension store
2. **Navigate to your website** where Mixpanel tracking is implemented
3. **Open the extension** by clicking the Mixpanel icon in your browser toolbar
4. **Interact with your site** to trigger events and see them appear in real-time
5. **Debug continuously** by opening the extension as a devtool window on Chrome through Inspect Element

## Common Use Cases & Best Practices

### Implementation Validation
**Use Cases:**
- Verify events are being sent correctly from your Mixpanel SDK
- Check that all expected properties are included in event payloads
- Confirm event timing and sequencing

**Best Practices:**
- Keep the Data Inspector open while implementing new tracking
- Use the copy feature to document expected payload structures
- Search for critical properties to ensure consistent naming

### Debugging and Troubleshooting
**Use Cases:**
- Identify missing or malformed event properties
- Debug tracking issues before they reach production
- Validate A/B test or feature flag implementations

**Best Practices:**
- Start by checking if events appear in the extension
- Use JSON view to examine payload structure and values
- Search for specific properties that may be causing issues

### Quality Assurance & Testing
**Use Cases:**
- Examine complete event structure and nested properties
- Compare expected vs. actual event data
- Understand property naming conventions and values

**Best Practices:**
- Validate tracking across different user flows
- Copy and compare payloads between different test scenarios
- Use search to verify that required properties are present

### Property Discovery & Analysis
**Use Cases:**
- Search for specific properties across multiple events
- Copy JSON payloads for further analysis or documentation
- Identify inconsistencies in property implementation

**Best Practices:**
- Use search functionality to locate properties of interest quickly
- Copy payloads to share with team members or include in documentation
- Regularly review property naming and value consistency

## Troubleshooting

### Events Not Appearing
- **Verify SDK implementation:** Ensure Mixpanel SDK is properly installed and configured. See [JavaScript SDK documentation](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript) for installation methods.
- **Check browser console:** Look for JavaScript errors that might prevent tracking
- **Refresh the page:** Some events only fire during page initialization
- **Disable ad blockers:** Ad blockers may prevent events from being sent to Mixpanel servers

### Support

For technical support or feature requests:
- Report issues through your standard Mixpanel support channels
- Include browser version and extension version in reports
- Provide specific JSON payload examples when reporting data issues
