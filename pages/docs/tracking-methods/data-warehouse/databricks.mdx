> **Considerations:** the connection to Databricks is only supported **directly to clusters**. Connecting directly to jobs or SQL warehouses **is not currently supported**. The account used for the connection should have `can attach to` permissions to the cluster (and `can restart` if it auto-suspends), and `can use` to the warehouse the cluster leverages.

Complete the following steps to get your Databricks connector up and running:

1. Navigate to **Project Settings**, then select **Warehouse Sources**.
2. Click on `+ Add Connection` and select **Databricks**.
3. You should see a new page to create your databricks connector. In the first view, fill out the following fields before clicking  `Create Source`: 
    - ** Server Hostname ** - This is the hostname of your Databricks cluster. This can be found in your workspace URL, or by navigating to [JDBC/ODBC connection settings](https://docs.databricks.com/en/integrations/jdbc-odbc-bi.html#step)
    - ** HTTP Path ** - This is the HTTP path of the cluster you would like to connect to. This can be found in your cluster [JDBC/ODBC connection settings](https://docs.databricks.com/en/integrations/jdbc-odbc-bi.html#step)
    - ** Access Token ** - This is the Personal access token used to authenticate with your Databricks cluster. Here are the instructions on [how to create an access token](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth.html#databricks-personal-access-tokens-for-workspace-users)
4. In the second view, you should see that the credentials are validated and a source is added.
