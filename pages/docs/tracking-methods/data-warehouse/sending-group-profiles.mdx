# Sending Group Profiles

### Format Data for Mixpanel Ingestion

To import data from a warehouse directly, make sure the tables are formatted correctly.

Each column in the table will be mapped as a group property for a single group key.  

Read more about best practices for Group Analytics in Mixpanel [here](/docs/data-structure/advanced/group-analytics).


### Group Tables

Once you have created a warehouse source, follow the below steps to send user profiles into Mixpanel.
1. Go to Project Settings > Warehouse Data.
2. Click on + Create and select Group Table.
3. Select your warehouse as source from the dropdown.
4. Navigate to the dataset or database where your Group table is.
5. Select the Table.
6. Specify what group key this table contains. See more about setting up Group keys [here](/docs/data-structure/advanced/group-analytics#group-keys-in-project-settings).
7. Specify which column contains the group ID.

#### Profile History via Slowly Changing Dimensions Type 2 Tables

Profile History allows you to point Mixpanel at a group table formatted as [Slowly Changing Dimensions Type 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension#Type_2:_add_new_row). This allows you to set up reports to analyze the historic values of group properties, in addition to latest value.

Setup instructions:
1. When creating a new Group Table, there will be a Type option. Select History Table.
2. Map the Group Key to the appropriate group, Group ID to the Group ID column and Start Time to the Start Time column.
3. You will only have the option for a Time Based sync for a History Table. See below for further setup information.


**Note:** For billing purposes each update in the SCD Type 2 table is processed as events.
During early access there is no charge for updates, however high volumes of updates
relative to a project's event plan limit may make the project unsuitable for early access. Also, there is a 90 day lookback limit for updates during early access so we recommend doing daily or monthly snapshots even if there are no delta updates to ensure profile history values do not show as (not set). This restriction will be lifted when the feature becomes generally available.


### Sync Settings
After pointing Mixpanel at your group table, you can select a Sync Type option. The options are: 
- Time Based: 
    - If you select this, you will need to add a mapping to an Insert Time column. We expect this to be a monotonically increasing TIMESTAMP_NTZ. We use this as a water mark to figure out which group profile updates are new and ingest them. This allows you to only send Mixpanel delta updates, which would mean paying lower egress and compute costs.
    - If there are groups profile with the same group ID, the profile with the latest timestamp column will take precedent.  
- Full Sync: With this option, Mixpanel will periodically do a full sync on the entire table. This means that periodically, we will update all users' value even if there are no delta updates. 

Check the preview to ensure that everything looks correct, and then create the sync.
