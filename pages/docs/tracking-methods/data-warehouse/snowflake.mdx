Complete the following steps to get your Snowflake connector up and running:

1. Navigate to **Project Settings**, then select **Warehouse Sources**.
2. Click on `+ Add Connection` and select **Snowflake**.
3. You should see a new page to create your snowflake connector. In the first view, fill out the following fields before clicking  `Next`: 
    - Snowflake Account Name / URL
    - Username
    - Role
    - Authentication Type. We support both Password and Key Pair.
    Ensure that the corresponding commands have been successfully completed in your Snowflake instance.
        - For Password authentication:
            - Fill out the password field.
            - Copy the commands and run them within your Snowflake instance.
            - Be sure to fill out the password field in your command.
        - For Key Pair authentication:
            - Mixpanel will generate a secure key pair for your source per the Snowflake requirements.
            - The private key will be encrypted and stored securely, and used only when we need to communicate with your Snowflake instance.
            - Public key can be found in the suggested SQL to create your user.
4. In the second view, you can click `Create Source` after completing the following:
    - Warehouse
        - Enter the name of your warehouse (default value: **MIXPANEL_IMPORT_WAREHOUSE**).
        - We recommend creating a separate warehouse for Mixpanel, and ensuring that Mixpanel has the appropriate role permissions to access it.
        - Run the commands below in Snowflake.
            
            ```jsx
            CREATE WAREHOUSE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_WAREHOUSE WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = XSMALL AUTO_SUSPEND = 60 AUTO_RESUME = TRUE INITIALLY_SUSPENDED = FALSE;
            GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_WAREHOUSE TO ROLE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_ROLE;
            GRANT OPERATE ON WAREHOUSE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_WAREHOUSE TO ROLE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_ROLE;
            GRANT MONITOR ON WAREHOUSE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_WAREHOUSE TO ROLE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_ROLE; 
            ```
            
    - Storage Integration
        - This is required because Mixpanel will export the query results into a GCS bucket.
        - Default value: **MIXPANEL_IMPORT_STORAGE_INTEGRATION**
        
        ```jsx
        CREATE STORAGE INTEGRATION MIXPANEL_IMPORT_STORAGE_INTEGRATION
          TYPE = EXTERNAL_STAGE
          STORAGE_PROVIDER = 'GCS'
          ENABLED = TRUE
          STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS = ("gcs://mixpanel-2946576-ca470bce1e1ed2ec");
        GRANT USAGE ON INTEGRATION MIXPANEL_IMPORT_STORAGE_INTEGRATION TO MIXPANEL_IMPORT_ROLE; 
        ```
        
    - Database (optional)
        - Enter the name of the database you want to grant permission to.
        - By default, we request read-only access.
        - Mixpanel does not store the access information. However, you can choose to provide more granular access if you desire.
        
        ```jsx
        GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE "<your_data_base>" TO ROLE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_ROLE;
        GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "<your_data_base>" TO ROLE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_ROLE;
        GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE "<your_data_base>" TO ROLE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_ROLE;
        GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE "<your_data_base>" TO ROLE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_ROLE;
        ```

### IP Allowed List
If you are using [Snowflake Network policy](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/network-policies) to restrict access to your instance, you might need to add the following IP addresses to the allowed list.

```jsx
34.31.112.201
34.147.68.192
35.184.21.33
35.225.176.74
35.204.164.122
35.204.177.251
```

### Mirror Sync Readiness

<Callout type="info">
  Mirror syncing is in early access and not available on all projects. Request access
  <a href="https://forms.gle/x8mbU6FVe5uHiVXF6">here</a>.
</Callout>

Mirror syncs use [Snowflake streams](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/streams-intro) to track all changes (inserts, updates, and deletes) to source tables. [`CHANGE_TRACKING`](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-table) must be enabled on a Snowflake table in order for a Mirror sync to be created from it.
```jsx
ALTER TABLE <database>.<schema>.<table> SET CHANGE_TRACKING = TRUE;
```

When using Mirror syncs Mixpanel creates and manages Snowflake streams in the source warehouse and needs the `CREATE STREAM` permission on a Snowflake schema to store these streams. We recommend creating a new empty schema solely for Mixpanel. For example:
```jsx
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS MIXPANEL_STREAM_DATABASE;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS MIXPANEL_STREAM_DATABASE.MIXPANEL_STREAM_SCHEMA;

-- Grant your Mixpanel role access to create streams in the schema
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE MIXPANEL_STREAM_DATABASE TO ROLE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_ROLE;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA MIXPANEL_STREAM_DATABASE.MIXPANEL_STREAM_SCHEMA TO ROLE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_ROLE;
GRANT CREATE STREAM ON SCHEMA MIXPANEL_STREAM_DATABASE.MIXPANEL_STREAM_SCHEMA TO ROLE MIXPANEL_IMPORT_ROLE;
```

To create a new Mirror-ready Snowflake source follow the steps above and fill out the additional two fields "Stream Database" and "Stream Schema" in step 4.

To update an existing source to be Mirror-ready:
1. Navigate to **Project Settings**, then select **Warehouse Sources**.
2. Find the source to update. The source's card should include a note **Mirror: Additional Setup Required**. Click "Additional Setup Required" to be taken to the source configuration page.
3. Fill in the two fields "Stream Database" and "Stream Schema". Press Save.
