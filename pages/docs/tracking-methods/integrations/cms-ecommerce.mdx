# CMS & E-Commerce

It's easy to integrate Mixpanel in CMS or E-Commerce sites with minimal code. Most approaches require adding our [Javascript snippet](/docs/quickstart/connect-your-data), which will automatically track all pageviews, and then customizing with additional `.track()` calls to track custom events.

## Wordpress
Though Mixpanel does not have an official plugin to support WordPress, there are plenty of options for getting Mixpanel set up on your WordPress site.

There are a variety of third-party options available that will automatically send data from your WordPress blog to your Mixpanel implementation. Some popular options include [third-party plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/mixpanel/). Most of these third-party plugins essentially just track page loads, which means you would be tracking some data, but not really fully utilizing the potential of Mixpanel. Though none are officially supported by Mixpanel, they might be worth checking out if you’re looking for a quick and simple solution.

However, to really exercise the power of Mixpanel, you can do a custom implementation, integrating Mixpanel the same way as any other platform by following the [JavaScript API integration steps](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript).

[One option is to build a child theme in WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) to be able to track events beyond page views. For example, if you have a plugin for a contact form in the page, you could modify the plugin to add the JavaScript specific to the Event within the form.

## Shopify
Even though the integration process is largely the same as the regular [JavaScript API Integration](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript), there are a few things specific to Shopify that you’ll want to account for.

To start, add the Mixpanel JavaScript snippet into the tag of your theme.liquid page. Then, once the library has been successfully loaded, implement `mixpanel.track()` calls wherever you see fit.

Mixpanel users who have successfully implemented on a Shopify site [have some great recommendations and tips on key locations to place mixpanel.track() calls](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28160415/shopify-mixpanel-integration/34442476#34442476).

In order to view accurate data on conversions from shopping to checkout (a key Funnel for most ecommerce businesses), you’ll need to take a few additional steps since your shop domain is different than the Shopify checkout domain. However, as a shop, you don’t have control over the Shopify checkout page. So instead, you’ll want to pass the distinct_id to the URL on click, then on the Shopify page, parse and execute the Mixpanel methods.

Another consideration with Shopify sites and Mixpanel is that because the checkout page is a separate domain with its own cookie, Initial Referring Domain Properties sent from the checkout page will come through with a referrer of your own Shopify site. You can use the same method described above of passing the `$initial_referring_domain` Property to the URL, parse and then execute.

If you are looking for a no-code solution, check out the [Vendo app by Growth Analytics Marketing](https://mixpanel.com/partners/integrations/vendo) (a Mixpanel solution and technology partner), available in the Shopify app store. Vendo automatically sends data from your Shopify store front-end and back-end to your Mixpanel project. Vendo offers a 30-day free trial and a free plan.

## PrestaShop
To get up and running with Mixpanel on a PrestaShop site, paste the [Mixpanel JavaScript snippet](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript) in the header.tpl file between `{literal} {/literal}` tags. Once you’ve successfully initialized the Mixpanel library, add mixpanel.track calls per the standard JavaScript integration documentation.
