# Google Tag Manager

This document walks through Mixpanel's native integration with Google Tag Manager. The source code lives [here](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-gtm-template).

## Installation
Note: You can also watch our video walkthrough [here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/556882/154125933-b584de10-b7fa-4668-b815-7429192d867a.mp4).

The easiest way to install the custom template is to locate it in the [Google Tag Manager community template gallery](https://tagmanager.google.com/gallery/#/owners/mixpanel/templates/mixpanel-gtm-template), and you can install it via the Google Tag Manager user interface.

To **manually install** the template, e.g. for debugging prior to the changes being published in the community template gallery, follow these steps.

1. Download the `./src/template.tpl` file locally.
2. Open a **Google Tag Manager** *Web* container via the [Google Tag Manager user interface](https://tagmanager.google.com/). Preferably one that is already deployed on a website where you can test the template with real use cases.
3. In the GTM UI, browse to **Templates**, and in the box titled **Tag Templates**, click the blue **New** button.
4. Once the **Template Editor** is open, click the menu (three vertical dots) in the top-right corner of the window and choose **Import**.
5. Select the `template.tpl` file you downloaded locally.
6. Follow the prompts. Once the import is complete, the Template Editor should show the Mixpanel template in edit mode.
7. Click **Save** to save the template, and then proceed to close the Template Editor.
8. In the GTM UI, browse to **Tags** and click **New** to create a new tag.
9. From the list of available tag templates, choose the **Mixpanel** template you just imported to the container.

## How It Works

The template brings the functionality of the [Mixpanel JS SDK](https://developer.mixpanel.com/docs/javascript-full-api-reference) to Google Tag Manager so that you can implement Mixpanel through the Tag Manager interface instead of a direct implementation in code. You will need to define and fire tags using this template to make Mixpanel SDK calls to track events and identify users.

It utilizes a custom-created [JavaScript wrapper](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-js-wrapper) to overcome the restrictions GTM's templating system places on available JavaScript APIs.

### Initialization

When *any* Mixpanel GTM tag fires, it automatically tries to initialize a new instance using the **Initialization Options** configured in the tag. If an instance with the given name has already been initialized on the page, the initialization process will be skipped.

This way, the user doesn't need to worry about initialization; just ensure that the Initialization Options are configured consistently across the tags.

#### Custom Initialization Options

To add initialization options for capabilities like [session replay](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript#implementation--sampling) (`record_sessions_percent`)or [heatmaps](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript#heatmaps-beta) (`record_heatmap_data`) to Google Tag Manager:

1\. Add a new tag in GTM and choose the Mixpanel tag type

2\. For the Project Token field, enter your Mixpanel project token

3\. For Tag Type, select init from the dropdown

4\. For Initialization, choose Set Options Manually

5\. In the Option key / Option value section, add the relevant key-value pair according to your needs (e.g., `record_heatmap_data` as the key and set a boolean value of `true`)

6\. For the Triggering section, choose an early GTM lifecycle event like Initialization \- All Pages or Consent Initialization \- All Pages

#### GTM with custom Autocapture initialization options

To use [autocapture initialization options](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript#autocapture) like `capture_extra_attrs` with GTM, you'll need to create a custom JavaScript variable in GTM and then use that variable for your autocapture configuration. Here's how to do it:

##### **1\. Create a Custom JavaScript Variable in GTM**

First, create a Custom JavaScript variable that returns the autocapture configuration object:

1\. In GTM, go to Variables \> User-Defined Variables \> New

2\. Choose "Custom JavaScript" as the variable type

3\. Add code that returns the autocapture configuration object, including the `capture_extra_attrs` option

For example, the Custom JavaScript variable might look like this:

```javascript Javascript
function() {

 return {

   pageview: "full-url",

   click: true,

   input: true,

   scroll: true,

   submit: true,

   capture_extra_attrs: ['data-cta-name', 'data-cta-position']

 };

}
```

##### **2\. Use the Variable in Your Mixpanel Tag**

Once the custom variable is created:

1\. Edit the Mixpanel initialization tag in GTM

2\. For the Autocapture option, instead of selecting "Enabled" or "Disabled" from the dropdown, select the custom JavaScript variable

##### **3\. Verify Your Implementation**

After setting up the tag with the custom variable:

1\. Use GTM's preview mode to verify that the tag is firing correctly

2\. Check in the browser's developer console that the Mixpanel configuration includes the custom autocapture settings

3\. Verify in Mixpanel that the extra attributes are being captured with your events

This approach allows for customized autocapture options beyond the simple enabled/disabled toggle that's available in the standard GTM template interface.

### Sending Mixpanel Commands

After adding the **Project Token** to its respective field, you need to choose what **type** of tag to use. Each type corresponds with some command you can use with the Mixpanel JS API.

> Note that `'init'`, `'push'`, and any of the "getter" commands are not supported in the template.

The more complex tag types (`group`, `people`, and `track`) are elevated to the top of the drop-down menu with the `-` prefix to separate them from the other commands.

Once you select a tag type, additional options may appear. Please have a look at the SDK reference for details on how to configure these options.

### Firing The Tag

Once you're happy with your tag, add a **Trigger** to it. For example, to trigger it with every page load, add the **All Pages** trigger.

Save the tag when done.

### Testing

You can then enter **Preview** mode by clicking the blue **Preview** button in the Google Tag Manager UI. This opens a new tab with your website running the GTM container, and you can proceed to test the Mixpanel tag as if the container were published. In the Tag Assistant Preview tab, you can see additional information about the trigger events, tags, and variables that fire while you are browsing the page in Preview mode.
