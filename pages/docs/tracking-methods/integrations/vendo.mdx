# Vendo

## Overview

The Vendo integration with Mixpanel enables you to seamlessly sync events and properties across different data sources. This guide provides instructions on how to set up and configure Vendo to sync data to Mixpanel.

## How the Integration Works

Vendo collects event data from various sources like ad platforms, payment platforms and transforms the messages to match Mixpanel’s event schema, and forwards the enriched data into your Mixpanel project. Vendo also archives a copy of the data and can route it to additional storage systems if needed.

Mixpanel is one of the supported downstream destinations for Vendo. With this integration, you can seamlessly send data from your Vendo sources into your Mixpanel project.

For details about connections and configuration options, see [Vendo Developer Docs](https://docs.vendodata.com/en/).

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- **Vendo Account:** Access to your Vendo dashboard.
- **Mixpanel Project:** An active Mixpanel project with API keys.
- **App Access:** Access to the apps that you want to connect with Vendo.
