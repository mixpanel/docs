# Mixpanel Session Replay SDKs: Android

## Getting started

The Session Replay SDK for Android is an supplementary SDK that complements the [main Android SDK](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/android), enabling you to visually replay your users' app interactions through the [Session Replay](/docs/session-replay) feature. Please refer to our [developer guide on implementing Session Replay](/docs/session-replay/implement-session-replay/session-replay-android) for a detailed walkthrough.

If you have not installed the main Swift SDK yet, navigate to the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/quickstart).

The [Library Source Code](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-android-session-replay-package) is documented in our GitHub repo.

## Installing the Library

You can integrate the Mixpanel Android Session Replay SDK into your Android project by embedding the Android Archive (AAR) file below.

1. Open your existing Android Studio project where you want to integrate the Mixpanel Android Session Replay SDK.
2. Download and unzip [mixpanel-android-session-replay.aar.zip](https://mxpnl.notion.site/Mixpanel-Android-Session-Replay-SDK-Alpha-1bbe0ba92562800dacdbec9cb597d397) to your local drive.
3. Copy the AAR file to the `app/libs` folder in your Android project.
4. Configure your project's Gradle settings:
    - For **Kotlin DSL (settings.gradle.kts)**: Add to the repositories section under `dependencyResolutionManagement`:

    ```kotlin Kotlin
    flatDir {
        dirs("libs")
    }
    ```
    - For **Groovy DSL (build.gradle)**: Add to the repositories section under `buildScripts`:

    ```groovy
    flatDir {
        dirs("libs")
    }
    ```
5. Add the following dependencies to your module's `build.gradle` or `build.gradle.kts`:

```gradle
implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-serialization-json:+")
implementation("com.squareup.curtains:curtains:+")
implementation(files("libs/mixpanel-android-session-replay.aar"))
```

6. Sync your project with Gradle files.

### Initialize

You should have the main Mixpanel Android SDK installed (minimum version `v8.0.2`). If not, please refer to the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/quickstart). 

Initialize the [`MPSessionReplay`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-android-session-replay/blob/13c5726c9573e329120959025cfd6b06b5b3d888/mixpanel-android-session-replay/src/main/java/com/mixpanel/mixpanel_android_session_replay/MPSessionReplay.kt) SDK in your `Application` class:

**Example Usage**

```kotlin
private fun initializeMixpanel() {
    val token = "MY_PROJECT_TOKEN"
    val trackAutomaticEvents = true
 
    val mixpanel = MixpanelAPI.getInstance(this, token, trackAutomaticEvents)
    mixpanel.identify("DISTINCT_ID")
 
 
    val config = MPSessionReplayConfig(
        wifiOnly = false,
        recordSessionsPercent = 100.0
    )
 
    MPSessionReplay.initialize(this, token, mixpanel.distinctId, config)
}
```

## Capturing Replays

<Callout type="warning">
	Test in a sandbox project and start with a smaller sample rate. This allows you to monitor performance, usage, and ensure your privacy rules align with your company policies.
</Callout>

You can capturing replay data using a sampling method (recommended), or customize when and where replays are captured manually using methods provided by the Session Replay Android SDK.

### Sampling

To enable Session Replay and set your sampling rate, create a [`SessionReplayConfig`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-android-session-replay/blob/13c5726c9573e329120959025cfd6b06b5b3d888/mixpanel-android-session-replay/src/main/java/com/mixpanel/mixpanel_android_session_replay/models/MPSessionReplayConfig.kt#L9) object and set the [`recordSessionsPercent`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-android-session-replay/blob/13c5726c9573e329120959025cfd6b06b5b3d888/mixpanel-android-session-replay/src/main/java/com/mixpanel/mixpanel_android_session_replay/models/MPSessionReplayConfig.kt#L11) with a value between `0.0` and `100.0`. 

At `0.0` no sessions will be recorded, at `100.0` all sessions will be recorded.

**Example Usage**

```kotlin
// records 1% of all sessions
MPSessionReplayConfig(
            recordSessionsPercent = 1.0
        )
```

### Manual Capture

To programatically start and stop replay capture, use the `.startRecording()` and `.stopRecording()` methods.

#### Start Recording

Call [`.startRecording()`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-android-session-replay/blob/13c5726c9573e329120959025cfd6b06b5b3d888/mixpanel-android-session-replay/src/main/java/com/mixpanel/mixpanel_android_session_replay/MPSessionReplayInstance.kt#L179) to force recording to begin, regardless of the `recordSessionsPercent` init option. 

The recording automatically stops when the app goes to the background. Therefore, if you want to continuously record the replays, you will need to restart the replay once the app becomes active again.

This will have no effect if replay data collection is already in progress.

**Example Usage**

```kotlin Kotlin
// manually trigger a replay capture
MPSessionReplay.getInstance()?.startRecording()
// no effect if recording is already in progress
```

#### Stop Recording

Call [`.stopRecording()`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-android-session-replay/blob/13c5726c9573e329120959025cfd6b06b5b3d888/mixpanel-android-session-replay/src/main/java/com/mixpanel/mixpanel_android_session_replay/MPSessionReplayInstance.kt#L222) to stop any active replay data collection. The SDK automatically stops recording when the app goes to the background.

**Example Usage**

```kotlin Kotlin
// manually end a replay capture
MPSessionReplay.getInstance()?.stopRecording()
// no effect if no recording in progress
```

### Config Options

Upon initialization you can provide a [`SessionReplayConfig`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-android-session-replay/blob/13c5726c9573e329120959025cfd6b06b5b3d888/mixpanel-android-session-replay/src/main/java/com/mixpanel/mixpanel_android_session_replay/models/MPSessionReplayConfig.kt#L9) object to customize your replay capture.

Currently, there are three config options:

| Option | Description | Default | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`wifiOnly`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-android-session-replay/blob/13c5726c9573e329120959025cfd6b06b5b3d888/mixpanel-android-session-replay/src/main/java/com/mixpanel/mixpanel_android_session_replay/models/MPSessionReplayConfig.kt#L10) | When `true`, replay events will only be flushed to the server when the device has a WiFi connection. If there is no wifi, flushes are skipped and the events remain in the in-memory queue until wifi is restored (or until the queue reaches its limit and the oldest events are evicted to make room for newer events). <br/> When `false`, replay events will be flushed with any network connection, including cellular. | `true` |
| [`recordSessionsPercent`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-android-session-replay/blob/13c5726c9573e329120959025cfd6b06b5b3d888/mixpanel-android-session-replay/src/main/java/com/mixpanel/mixpanel_android_session_replay/models/MPSessionReplayConfig.kt#L11) | This is a value between `0.0` and `100.0` that controls the sampling rate for recording session replays. <br/> At `0.0` no sessions will be recorded. At `100.0` all sessions will be recorded.  | `0.0` |
| [`autoMaskedViews`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-android-session-replay/blob/13c5726c9573e329120959025cfd6b06b5b3d888/mixpanel-android-session-replay/src/main/java/com/mixpanel/mixpanel_android_session_replay/models/MPSessionReplayConfig.kt#L12) | This is a `Set` of enum options for the types of views that should be masked by the SDK automatically. | `Image`, `Text`, and `Web` |

Note: automasking is supported for apps built with XML-based layouts. For apps using Jetpack Compose, automasking is not yet fully supported. Manual masking controls offer complete functionality, but developers should test carefully to confirm that masking behaves as expected.

**Example Usage**

```kotlin Kotlin
// mask images only
// only send recordings on wifi
MPSessionReplayConfig(
            wifiOnly = true,
            autoMaskedViews = mutableSetOf(AutoMaskedView.ImageView)
        )
```

#### Mark Views as Sensitive

Mark any views as sensitive by setting the `mpReplaySensitive` property to `true` or calling the [`addSensitiveView()`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-android-session-replay/blob/13c5726c9573e329120959025cfd6b06b5b3d888/mixpanel-android-session-replay/src/main/java/com/mixpanel/mixpanel_android_session_replay/sensitive_views/SensitiveViewManager.kt#L107) method. Views marked as "sensitive" will be masked.

Set `mpReplaySensitive` to `false` or calling the [`removeSensitiveView()`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-android-session-replay/blob/13c5726c9573e329120959025cfd6b06b5b3d888/mixpanel-android-session-replay/src/main/java/com/mixpanel/mixpanel_android_session_replay/MPSessionReplayInstance.kt#L157) to mark any view as safe. Views marked as "safe" will not be masked.

**Example Usage**

```kotlin Kotlin
// Compose
Image(
    painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.family_photo),
    contentDescription = "Family Photo",
    modifier = Modifier.mpReplaySensitive(true)
)
 
// XML
val creditCardView: ImageView = findViewById(R.id.creditCardView)
MPSessionReplay.getInstance()?.addSensitiveView(creditCardView)
```

All `EditText` and `TextView` components are masked by default. `EditText` cannot be unmasked, while `TextView` can be unmasked.

## Get Replay ID

Use the [`getReplayId()`]() method to return the [Replay ID](/docs/session-replay/implement-session-replay/session-replay-android#replay-id) for the current replay recording. The method will return an empty object if there is no active replay capture in progress.

**Example Usage**

```swift Swift
// return the $mp_replay_id for the currently active capture
MPSessionReplay.getInstance()?.getReplayId()
// {$mp_replay_id: '19221397401184-063a51e0c3d58d-17525637-1d73c0-1919139740f185'}
```

## Debug Mode

No toggle is needed to enable debug logs; logging is always enabled in your developer/debug environment.

## Replay Retention

User replays are stored for 30 days after the time of ingestion.
