# Mixpanel SDKs: React Native

## Getting Started

Please refer to our [Quickstart Guide](/docs/quickstart/connect-your-data?sdk=reactnative).

The [Full API Reference](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html), [Library Source Code](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-react-native), and an [Example Application](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-react-native/tree/master/Samples) is documented in our GitHub repo.

## Installing the Library

After [setting up your development environment for React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), navigate to your app's root directory and install the Mixpanel React Native SDK. The library requires React Native v0.6+.

```bash
npm install mixpanel-react-native
```

Then navigate tp your application's iOS folder, and install the dependencies. (Note you do not need to update your Podfile to add Mixpanel.)

```bash
pod install
```

<Callout type="info">
  Since Xcode 12.5, there is a known swift compile issue, please refer to [this workaround](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-react-native/issues/43#issuecomment-829599732). However the compile issue has been resolved in Xcode 13.2.1+, there is no extra step required as long as you upgrade to Xcode 13.2.1+.
</Callout>

After installation, import the `Mixpanel` class from the SDK, create an instance of Mixpanel using your [project token](/docs/orgs-and-projects/managing-projects#find-your-project-tokens), then initialize by calling [`.init()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#:~:text=init(token%2C%20trackAutomaticEvents%2C%20Optional)).

```javascript
//import Mixpanel class from the SDK
import { Mixpanel } from 'mixpanel-react-native';

// create an instance of Mixpanel using your project token
// disable legacy autotrack mobile events
const trackAutomaticEvents = false;
const mixpanel = new Mixpanel('YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN', trackAutomaticEvents);

//initialize Mixpanel
mixpanel.init();
```

### Library Configuration
The Mixpanel object can be initialized with different configurations. See below for a list of configuration options.

```javascript
//import Mixpanel class from the SDK
import { Mixpanel } from 'mixpanel-react-native';

const trackAutomaticEvents = false; // disable legacy autotrack mobile events
const useNative = true;             // use Native Mode
const serverURL = 'https://api.mixpanel.com';  // set the server URL to Mixpanel's US domain
const optOutTrackingDefault = false;           // opt users into tracking by default
const superProperties = {           // register super properties for the user
  'data_source':'MP-React'
  }

// create an instance of Mixpanel using your project token
// with the configuration options above
const mixpanel = new Mixpanel(
  'YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN',
  trackAutomaticEvents,
  useNative,
  serverURL,
  optOutTrackingDefault,
  superProperties
  );

//initialize Mixpanel
mixpanel.init();
```

### Javascript Mode

The Mixpanel React Native SDK supports Expo, React Native for Web, and other platforms utilizing React Native that do not support iOS and Android directly via Javascript Mode.

To enable Javascript Mode:

1. Install [`AsyncStorage`](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/) which is used to persist data. If this is unavailable in your target environment, you can import/define a different storage class. Please refer to [`this documentation.`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-react-native/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#expo-and-react-native-for-web-support-302-and-above)

```bash
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

2. Initializing the Mixpanel object with `useNative` set to `false`.

```javascript
//import Mixpanel class from the SDK
import { Mixpanel } from 'mixpanel-react-native';

const trackAutomaticEvents = false; //disable legacy mobile autotrack
const useNative = false;  //disable Native Mode, use Javascript Mode

// create new Mixpanel class
const mixpanel = new Mixpanel(
  'YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN',
  trackAutomaticEvents,
  useNative
  );

// initialize Mixpanel
mixpanel.init();
```

When using Javascript Mode:
* [Legacy Automatically Tracked Events](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/android#legacy-automatically-tracked-events) are not supported
* Javascript Mode does not have the same default properties as Native Mode
* Data does not automatically flush when the app is backgrounded. Be sure to call [`.flush()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#flush) more frequently for key events

## Sending Events
Use the [`.track()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#track) method to send an event by providing the event name and any event properties. This will trigger a request to the [/track API endpoint](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/track-event) to ingest the event into your project.

<Callout type="info">
  The [/track endpoint](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/track-event) will only validate events with timestamps within the last 5 days of the request. Events with timestamps older than 5 days will not be ingested. See below on best practices for historical imports.
</Callout>

**Example Usage**
```javascript
// track "some_event" with "some property" set to "some_value"
mixpanel.track('some_event', {
  some_property: 'some_value'
});
```
### Timing Events

You can track the time it took for an action to occur, such as an image upload or a comment post, using [`.timeEvent()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#timeEvent). This will mark the "start" of your action, which will be timed until you finish with a track call. The time duration is then recorded in the "Duration" property.

**Example Usage**
```javascript
// start the timer for the event "Image Upload"
mixpanel.timeEvent("Image Upload");

// 20 seconds later...

// track "Image Upload" event
// "Duration" event property set to 20
mixpanel.track("Image Upload");
```

### Flushing Events
To preserve battery life and customer bandwidth, the Mixpanel library doesn't send the events you record immediately. Instead, it sends batches to the Mixpanel servers every 60 seconds while your application is running, as well as when the application transitions to the background. 

Call [`.flush()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#flush) manually if you want to force a flush at a particular moment.

**Example Usage**
```javascript Javascript
// flush queued events immediately
mixpanel.flush();
```

**Flush Batch Size**

By default, Mixpanel will flush events immediately if a batch reaches 50 events. Use the [`.setFlushBatchSize()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#setFlushBatchSize) method to adjust the batch size limit for flushing.

**Example Usage**
```javascript Javascript
// flush if event batch size reaches 100
mixpanel.setFlushBatchSize(100);
```

#### Importing Historical Events
The React Native SDK is a tracking SDK designed for real-time tracking in a client-side environment. Calling `track()` triggers a request to our [/track API endpoint](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/track-event), which will validate for events with a timestamp that is within the last 5 days of the request. **Events older than 5 days will not be ingested**.

For bulk import of historical events older than 5 days, we will need to use the [/import API endpoint](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/import-events) which is optimized for scripting and supports ingesting historical data. We recommend the [Python SDK](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/python) (see the [`.import_data()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-python/#primary-interface) function) and [mixpanel-utils module](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-utils) (see the [`import_events()`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-utils?tab=readme-ov-file#import-events) function) which both leverages the /import API for event ingestion.


## Setting Super Properties
Super properties are global event properties that you define once and apply to all events.

To register super properties, call [`.registerSuperProperties()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#registerSuperProperties).

Use [`.registerSuperPropertiesOnce()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#registerSuperPropertiesOnce) to register super properties without overwriting existing values.

**Example Usage**
```javascript
// register "name" as a super property
mixpanel.registerSuperProperties({
    name: 'Sam',
});
 
// register "city" as an additional super property
// ignore "name" since it already exists
mixpanel.registerSuperPropertiesOnce({
    name: 'Samantha',
    city: 'San Francisco'
});
 
// track a "registration" event
// the event will include the "name" property set to "Sam"
// and "city" set to "San Francisco"
mixpanel.track('registration');
```

If you have properties you'd like all events to include, you can also set the super properties when initializing the Mixpanel object.

**Example Usage**
```javascript
// define super properties as a key-value pair
const superProperties = {
  name: 'Sam',
  city: 'San Francisco'
};

// create new Mixpanel class with the superProperties
const mixpanel = new Mixpanel(
  'YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN',
  superProperties
  );

//initialize Mixpanel
mixpanel.init();

// track "some_event"
// "name" and "city" added as event properties
mixpanel.track('some_event');
```

Our mobile libraries store your super properties in local storage. They will persist so long as the app is installed (between launches and updates). Uninstalling the app will remove that customers super properties.

See more methods related to super properties in the complete library reference [here](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html).


## Managing User Identity
You can handle the identity of a user using the [`.identify()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#identify) and [`.reset()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#reset) methods. Learn more about [identity management](/docs/tracking-methods/id-management/identity-management) and [identifying users](/docs/tracking-methods/id-management/identifying-users).

### Identify
<Callout type="warning">
    We recommend against calling `.identify()` for anonymous visitors to your site.
</Callout>

Call [`.identify()`]((https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#identify)) when you know the identity of the current user, passing in their user ID as an argument. This is typically at account registration and at log in.

**Example Usage**
```javascript
// your user signs in and tracks a sign in event
mixpanel.track('sign in');
 
// upon sign in, identify the user with their ID
// ensure future events sent from the user have distinct_id 12345
mixpanel.identify('12345');
```


### Call Reset at Logout
Call [`.reset()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#reset) to clear data attributed to a user when they logout. This will clear the local storage and allows you to handle [multiple users on a single device](/docs/tracking-methods/id-management/identifying-users-simplified#multiple-users-one-device). 

**Example Usage**
```javascript Javascript
// your user logs out and tracks a log out event
mixpanel.track('log out');

// clear local storage and generate new distinct_id
mixpanel.reset();
```

## Storing User Profiles
Once your users are identified, create [user profiles](/docs/data-structure/user-profiles) by setting profile properties to describe them. Example profile properties include "name", "email", "company", and any other demographic details about the user.

The React Native SDK provides a few methods for setting profile properties under the [`People`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/People.html) class accessible via [`.getPeople()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#getPeople). These methods will trigger requests to the [/engage API endpoint](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/profile-set).

### Setting Profile Properties

<Callout type="info">
  You must call `.identify()` before setting profile properties in order to associate the profile properties you set with the target user. If identify is not called, the profile update will be queued for ingestion until an identify call is made.
</Callout>

Set profile properties on a user profile by calling the [`.getPeople().set()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/People.html#set) method.

If a profile property already exist, if will be overwritten with the latest value provided in the method. If a profile property does not exist, it will be added to the profile.

**Example Usage**
```javascript Javascript
// You must call identify to associate the profile update with the user
// Create "plan" profile prop for user "12345"
mixpanel.identify('12345');
mixpanel.getPeople().set('plan', 'Premium');

// We only need to call identify once per page load
// Update "plan" from "Premium" to "Enterprise"
mixpanel.getPeople().set('plan', 'Enterprise');

// set multiple profile props at once
// by passing an object
let properties = {'plan':'Premium','company':'mixpanel'};
mixpanel.getPeople().set(properties);

```

### Other Types of Profile Updates
There are a few other methods for setting profile properties. See a complete reference of the available methods [here](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/People.html).

A few commonly used people methods are highlighted below:

<Tabs items={['.setOnce()','.append()','.union()','.increment()']} >
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The [`.getPeople().setOnce()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/People.html#setOnce) method set profile properties only if they do not exist yet. If it is setting a profile property that already exists, it will be ignored.

    Use this method if you want to set profile properties without the risk of overwriting existing data.

    **Example Usage**
    ```javascript
    // set profile properties for user "1234"
    mixpanel.identify('1234');
    let properties = {name: 'Sam'};
    mixpanel.getPeople().set(properties);
    
    // will be ignored since "name" already exists
    mixpanel.getPeople().setOnce('name', 'Samantha');

    // "email" will be set since it does not exist
    mixpanel.getPeople().setOnce('email', 'test@mail.com');
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The [`.getPeople().append()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/People.html#append) method append values to a list profile property.

    Use this method to add additional values to an existing list property instead of redefining the entire list.

    **Example Usage**
    ```javascript
    // set profile properties for user "1234"
    mixpanel.identify('1234');
    let properties = {
        name: 'Sam',
        roles: ['sales','engineer']
    }
    mixpanel.getPeople().set(properties);
    
    // add "legal" to "roles"
    // new "roles" value is ['sales','engineer','legal']
    mixpanel.getPeople().append('roles', 'legal');

    // .appen() allows duplicates
    // new "roles" value is ['sales','engineer','legal','legal']
    mixpanel.getPeople().append('roles', 'legal');
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The [`.getPeople().union()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/People.html#union) method append new values to a list property, excluding duplicates.

    Use this method to create a list profile property that only contains unique values without duplicates.

    **Example Usage**
    ```javascript
    // set profile properties for user "1234"
    mixpanel.identify('1234');
    let properties = {
        name: 'Sam',
        roles: ['sales','engineer']
    }
    mixpanel.getPeople().set(properties);
    
    
    // add "engineer" to "roles"
    // will be ignored since "engineer" already exists in "roles"
    mixpanel.getPeople().union('roles', 'engineer');

    // add "legal" to "roles" since it does not exist
    mixpanel.getPeople().union('roles', 'legal');
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The [`.getPeople().increment()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/People.html#increment) method increments a numeric property by a whole number.

    Use this method to add to or subtract from your numeric property based on its current value.

    **Example Usage**
    ```javascript
      // set profile properties for user "1234"
      mixpanel.identify('1234');
      let properties = {
          name: 'Sam',
          age: 25,
      }

      // increment "age" by 2
      mixpanel.getPeople().increment('age',2);
      
      // use negative number to decrement
      // decrement "age" by 5
      mixpanel.getPeople().increment('age',-5);
      ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Group Analytics

<Callout type="info">
    Read more about [Group Analytics](/docs/data-structure/group-analytics) before proceeding. You will need to have the [group key defined in your project settings](/docs/data-structure/group-analytics#group-keys-in-project-settings) first.
</Callout>

Mixpanel [Group Analytics](/docs/data-structure/group-analytics) is a paid add-on that allows behavioral data analysis by groups (e.g. company, team), as opposed to individual users.

A group is identified by the `group_key` and `group_id`.
* `group_key` is the event property that connects event data to a group. (e.g. `company`)
* `group_id` is the identifier for a specific group. (e.g. `mixpanel`,`company_a`,`company_b`, etc.)

The React Native SDK provides a few method for adding individual users to a group and setting group profile properties.

### Adding Users to a Group
[All events must have the group key as an event property in order to be attributed to a group](/docs/data-structure/group-analytics#group-keys-tracked-as-event-properties). Without the group key, an event cannot be attributed to a group.

Call the [`.setGroup()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#setGroup) method to register the current user to a group, which would add the `group_key` as an event property set to the `group_id` value to all events moving forward. 

```javascript Javascript
// assign the current user to the "mixpanel" company group
mixpanel.setGroup('company', 'mixpanel');
 
// track "some_event"
// event property "company" = ["mixpanel"] is added automatically
mixpanel.track('some_event');
 
// alternatively you can manually set the group key on each event
mixpanel.track('some_event',{
    company: ['mixpanel']
});
```

**Multiple Groups**

[An event can be attributed to multiple groups](/docs/data-structure/group-analytics#attribute-events-to-multiple-groups) by passing in the `group_key` value as a list of multiple `group_id` values.

Call [`.addGroup()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#addGroup) to add additional `group_id`s to an existing list.

**Example Usage**
```javascript
// assign the current user to the "mixpanel" company group
// events will contain 'company' prop set to ["mixpanel"]
mixpanel.setGroup('company', 'mixpanel');

// add "mp-us" as an additional company group
// new "company" value is ["mixpanel","mp-us"]
mixpanel.addGroup('company', 'mp-us');

// track "some_event"
// event property "company" = ["mixpanel","mp-us"] is added automatically
mixpanel.track('some_event');
```

### Adding Group Identifiers to User Profiles

To connect group information to a user profile, include the `group_key` and `group_id` as a user profile property using the `getPeople().set()` call.

**Example Usage**
```javascript Javascript
// You must call identify to associate the profile update with the user
// Create "plan" profile prop for user "12345"
mixpanel.identify('12345');
mixpanel.getPeople().set('plan', 'Premium');

// set group key "company" as a user prop
// with group id "mixpanel" as value
mixpanel.getPeople().set('company', 'mixpanel');
```

### Setting Group Profile Properties
Create a group profiles by setting group properties, similar to a user profile. For example, you may want to describe a company group with properties such as "ARR", "employee_count", and "subscription".

To set group profile properties, specify the group that needs to be updated by calling [`.getGroup()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#getGroup), then set the group properties by chaining the [`.set()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/MixpanelGroup.html#set) method, which will trigger a request to the [/groups API endpoint](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/group-set-property).

**Example Usage**
```javascript
// assign the current user to the "mixpanel" company group
mixpanel.setGroup('company', 'mixpanel');

// specify the target group using the group_key and group_id
// set "size" as a group profile prop to 100
mixpanel.getGroup('company','mixpanel').set('size',100);
```

### Other Group Profile Methods
See all of the methods under the Group class [here](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/MixpanelGroup.html).

A few commonly used group methods are highlighted below:

<Tabs items={['.setOnce()','.unset()','.union()','.remove()']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The [`.getGroup().setOnce()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/MixpanelGroup.html#setOnce) method set group profile properties only if they do not exist yet. If it is setting a profile property that already exists, it will be ignored.

    Use this method if you want to set group profile properties without the risk of overwriting existing data.

    **Example Usage**
    ```javascript
    // assign the current user to the "mixpanel" company group
    mixpanel.setGroup('company', 'mixpanel');

    // set group profile properties
    let properties = {
        name: 'Mixpanel',
    };
    mixpanel.getGroup('company','mixpanel').set(properties);

    // ignored since "name" is already exists
    mixpanel.getGroup('company','mixpanel').setOnce({
        name: 'mp'
    });

    // set "location" group prop since it does not exist
    mixpanel.getGroup('company','mixpanel').setOnce({
      location: 'us'
    });
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The [`.getGroup().unset()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/MixpanelGroup.html#unset) method removes a group property from a group profile.

    Use this method to delete unwanted group profile properties from a specific group profile.

    **Example Usage**
    ```javascript
    // assign the current user to the "mixpanel" company group
    mixpanel.setGroup('company', 'mixpanel');

    // set group profile properties
    let properties = {
        name: 'Mixpanel',
        employee_count: 100
    };
    mixpanel.getGroup('company','mixpanel').set(properties);

    // delete "employee_count" from the group profile
    mixpanel.getGroup('company','mixpanel').unset('employee_count');

    // only "name" remains as group profile prop
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The [`.getGroup().union()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/MixpanelGroup.html#union) method append new values to a list property, excluding duplicates.

    Use this method to create a list group profile property that only contains unique values without duplicates.

    **Example Usage**
    ```javascript
    // assign the current user to the "mixpanel" company group
    mixpanel.setGroup('company', 'mixpanel');

    // set group profile properties
    let properties = {
        name: 'Mixpanel',
        features: ['reports','alerts','cohorts'],
    };
    mixpanel.getGroup('company','mixpanel').set(properties);

    // add "data pipeline" to the "features" prop
    // ignore "alert" since it is a duplicate value
    mixpanel.getGroup('company','mixpanel').union('features', [
        'data pipeline',
        'alert'
        ]);

    //remove "alert" from "features"
    mixpanel.getGroup('company','mixpanel').remove('features', 'alert');
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The [`.getGroup().remove()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/MixpanelGroup.html#remove) method removes a value from a list-valued group profile property.

    Use this method to remove specific values from a list without affecting all of the other values in the list.

    **Example Usage**
    ```javascript
    // assign the current user to the "mixpanel" company group
    mixpanel.setGroup('company', 'mixpanel');

    // set group profile properties
    let properties = {
        name: 'Mixpanel',
        features: ['reports','alerts','cohorts'],
    };
    mixpanel.getGroup('company','mixpanel').set(properties);

    //remove "alert" from "features"
    // features now contain ["reports","cohorts"]
    mixpanel.getGroup('company','mixpanel').remove('features', 'alert');
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Debug Mode

To enable debug mode, call the [.setLoggingEnabled()](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#setLoggingEnabled) with `true`, then run your iOS project with Xcode or android project with Android Studio. The logs will be available in the console.

**Example Usage**

<Callout type="info">
    Remove this parameter before going into production.
</Callout>

```javascript
// enable debug log in the console
mixpanel.setLogginEnabled(true);
```

Learn more about [debugging](/docs/tracking-best-practices/debugging).

## Privacy-Friendly Tracking
You have control over the data you send to Mixpanel. The React Native SDK provide methods to help you protect user data.

Learn more about [Privacy](/docs/privacy/overview).

### Opt Out of Tracking
The React Native SDK is initialized with tracking enabled by default. Use the [`.optOutTracking()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#optOutTracking) method to opt the user out of data tracking and local storage for the current Mixpanel instance.

**Example Usage**
```javascript
//send "some_event"
mixpanel.track('some_event');

// opt user out of tracking
// SDK is prevented from sending any data
mixpanel.optOutTracking();

// this track call will not work
mixpanel.track('some_other_event');
```

**Opt Out by Default**

You can initialize the library with users opted out of tracking by default using the `optOutTrackingDefault` configuration. Once the user is ready to be tracked, call [`.optInTracking()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#optInTracking) to start tracking.

**Example Usage**

```javascript
//import Mixpanel class from the SDK
import { Mixpanel } from 'mixpanel-react-native';

const optOutTracking = true; // opt users out of tracking by default
const trackAutomaticEvents = false;

// create new Mixpanel class with your configurations
const mixpanel = new Mixpanel(
  'YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN',
  trackAutomaticEvents,
  optOutTrackingDefault
  );
// initialize Mixpanel
mixpanel.init();

// this track call will not work
mixpanel.track('some_event');

//opt user in to tracking
mixpanel.optInTracking();

// send "some_other_event"
mixpanel.track('some_other_event');
```

### EU Data Residency
Route data to Mixpanel's EU servers by calling `.setServerURL()` to set the `serverURL` to `https://api-eu.mixpanel.com` after initializing the client.

Learn more about [EU Data Residency](/docs/privacy/eu-residency).

**Example Usage**
```javascript
// set the Mixpanel instance to send data using Mixpanel's EU domain
mixpanel.setServerURL('https://api-eu.mixpanel.com');
```

### India Data Residency
Route data to Mixpanel's India servers by calling `.setServerURL()` to set the `serverURL` to `https://api-in.mixpanel.com` after initializing the client.

Learn more about [India Data Residency](/docs/privacy/in-residency).

**Example Usage**
```javascript
// set the Mixpanel instance to send data using Mixpanel's EU domain
mixpanel.setServerURL('https://api-in.mixpanel.com');
```

### Disable Geolocation

The React Native SDK parse the request IP address to generate geolocation properties for events and profiles. To disable geolocation, call the [`setUseIpAddressForGeolocation()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-react-native/Mixpanel.html#setUseIpAddressForGeolocation) method with a value of `false`.

Learn more about [geolocation](/docs/tracking-best-practices/geolocation).

**Example Usage**
```javascript
 // disable IP address for geolocation parsing
mixpanel.setUseIpAddressForGeolocation(false);

```

## Tracking Via Proxy

You can route events from Mixpanel's SDKs via a proxy in your own domain, which can reduce the likelihood of ad-blockers impacting your tracking.

There are two steps: setting up a proxy server and pointing our JavaScript SDK at your server.

**Step 1: Set up a proxy server**

The simplest way is to use our [sample nginx config](https://github.com/mixpanel/tracking-proxy). This config redirects any calls made to your proxy server to Mixpanel.

**Step 2: Point our React Native SDK at your server**

When initializing, replace `<YOUR_PROXY_DOMAIN>` with your proxy server's domain for `serverURL`.

```javascript
const serverURL = '<YOUR_PROXY_DOMAIN>';  // set the server URL to your proxy
const trackAutomaticEvents = false;

// create an instance of Mixpanel using your project token
// with the configuration options above
const mixpanel = new Mixpanel(
  'YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN',
  trackAutomaticEvents,
  serverURL
  );

//initialize Mixpanel
mixpanel.init();
```
