# Mixpanel SDKs: iOS (Swift)

## Getting Started

Please refer to our [Quickstart Guide](/docs/quickstart/connect-your-data?sdk=swift).

The [Full API Reference](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/), [Library Source Code](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-swift), and an [Example Application](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-swift/tree/master/MixpanelDemo/MixpanelDemo) is documented in our GitHub repo.

## Installing the Library

You can install the Swift library by using CocoaPods, Carthage, or Swift Package Manager.

<Tabs items={['CocoaPods', 'Carthage', 'Swift Package Manager']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    1. Install CocoaPods by typing the following in your command line:

    ```bash
    # install CocoaPods
    gem install cocoapods
    ```

    2. After install CocoaPods, create a local CocoaPods spec mirror by running the following:

    ```bash
    # Create CocoaPods spec mirror
    pod setup
    ```

    3. Then navigate to your Xcode project directory and create a Podfile by running the following:

    ```bash
    # create Podfile in project directory
    pod init
    ```

    4. Open the Podfile that was generated and add the Mixpanel library to your dependencies:

    ```ruby Ruby
    target 'MyApp' do
      pod 'Mixpanel-swift'
    end
    ```

    5. Install the Mixpanel library and create a new Xcode workspace by running the following in the Xcode project directory:
    ```bash
    // install library in your dependencies
    pod install
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    Mixpanel supports [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#quick-start) to package your dependencies as a framework. Include the following dependency in your Cartfile:

    ```bash
    # add Mixpanel library to your dependencies
    github "mixpanel/mixpanel-swift"
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    1. In Xcode, select File \> Add Packages...

    2. Enter the package URL for [this repository](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-swift) and select version v2.8.0 or above.
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

After installing the library, import `Mixpanel` into `AppDelegate.swift` and initialize Mixpanel within [`application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1622921-application) using your [project token](/docs/orgs-and-projects/managing-projects#find-your-project-tokens).

```swift Swift
/// import Mixpanel class from the library
import Mixpanel

func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                 didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
    ...
    /// initialize Mixpanel using your project token
    Mixpanel.initialize(token: "YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN", 
        trackAutomaticEvents: false
        )
    ...
}
```

### Library Configuration

The Mixpanel instance can be customized with different configurations. The [.initialize()](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/Mixpanel.html) method accepts arguments that sets some configurations on your instance upon initialization. 

After initialization, you can further customize the instance using the configuration options [here](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html).

**Example Usage**
```swift Swift
/// import Mixpanel class from the library
import Mixpanel

func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                 didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
    ...
    /// set instance name to "currentInstance" at initialization
    Mixpanel.initialize(token: "YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN",
        trackAutomaticEvents: false,
        instanceName: "currentInstance"
        )

    //enable debug log after initialization
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().loggingEnabled = true
    ...
}
```

## Sending Events

Use [`.track(event:properties:)`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html#/s:8Mixpanel0A8InstanceC5track5event10propertiesySSSg_SDySSAA0A4Type_pGSgtF) to send an event by providing the event name and any event properties. This will trigger a request to the [/track API endpoint](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/track-event) to ingest the event into your project.

<Callout type="info">
  The [/track endpoint](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/track-event) will only validate events with timestamps within the last 5 days of the request. Events with timestamps older than 5 days will not be ingested. See below on best practices for historical imports.
</Callout>

**Example Usage**
```swift Swift
/// track "some_event" 
/// with "plan" event prop set to "Premium"
Mixpanel.mainInstance().track(event: "some_event",
    properties:["Plan": "Premium"])
```

### Timing Events

You can track the time it took for an action to occur, such as an image upload or a comment post, using [`.time(event:)`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html#/s:FC8Mixpanel16MixpanelInstance4timeFT5eventSS_T_). This will mark the "start" of your action, which you can then finish with a track call. The time duration is then recorded in the "Duration" property.

```swift Swift
/// start the timer for the event "Image Upload"
Mixpanel.mainInstance().time(event: "Image Upload")

/// 20 seconds later...

/// track "Image Upload" event with "Duration" event prop set to 20
Mixpanel.mainInstance().track(event: "Image Upload")
```

### Flushing Events
To preserve battery life and customer bandwidth, the Mixpanel library doesn't send the events you record immediately. Instead, it sends batches to the Mixpanel servers every 60 seconds while your application is running, as well as when the application transitions to the background. 

Call [`.flush()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html#/s:8Mixpanel0A8InstanceC5flush16performFullFlush10completionySb_yycSgtF) manually if you want to force a flush at a particular moment.

**Example Usage**
```swift Swift
/// flush batched events for ingestion immediately
Mixpanel.mainInstance().flush()
```

**Flush Interval**

You can update the default flush interval from 60 seconds to another interval using [`flushInterval`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html#/s:8Mixpanel0A8InstanceC13flushIntervalSdvp).

**Example Usage**
```swift Swift
/// set the flush interval to every 120 seconds
Mixpanel.mainInstance().flushInterval = 120
```

#### Importing Historical Events

The Swift SDK is a tracking SDK designed for real-time tracking in a client-side environment. Calling [`.track(event:properties:)`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html#/s:8Mixpanel0A8InstanceC5track5event10propertiesySSSg_SDySSAA0A4Type_pGSgtF) triggers a request to our [/track API endpoint](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/track-event), which will validate for events with a timestamp that is within the last 5 days of the request. **Events older than 5 days will not be ingested**.

For bulk import of historical events older than 5 days, we will need to use the [/import API endpoint](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/import-events) which is optimized for scripting and supports ingesting historical data. We recommend the [Python SDK](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/python) (see the [`.import_data()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-python/#primary-interface) function) and [mixpanel-utils module](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-utils) (see the [`import_events()`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-utils?tab=readme-ov-file#import-events) function) which both leverages the /import API for event ingestion.

## Setting Super Properties

Super properties are global event properties that you define once and apply to all events.

To register super properties, call [`.registerSuperProperties(_:)`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html#/s:8Mixpanel0A8InstanceC23registerSuperPropertiesyySDySSAA0A4Type_pGF).

Use [`.registerSuperPropertiesOnce(_:)`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html#/s:8Mixpanel0A8InstanceC27registerSuperPropertiesOnce_12defaultValueySDySSAA0A4Type_pG_AaF_pSgtF) to register super properties without overwriting existing values.

**Example Usage**
```swift Swift
/// register a "name" super property
Mixpanel.mainInstance().registerSuperProperties(["name": "Sam"])

/// track "some_event"
/// "name" is automatically added as an event prop
Mixpanel.mainInstance().track(event: "some_event")

// this is ignored because "name" already exists
Mixpanel.mainInstance().registerSuperPropertiesOnce(["name": "Samantha"])

/// register a "location" super property
Mixpanel.mainInstance().registerSuperPropertiesOnce(["location": "us"])
```

Our mobile libraries store your super properties in local storage. They will persist so long as the app is installed (between launches and updates). Uninstalling the app will remove that customers super properties.

See more methods related to super properties in the complete library reference [here](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html).


## Managing User Identity

You can handle the identity of a user using the [`.identify()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html#/s:8Mixpanel0A8InstanceC8identify10distinctId9usePeople10completionySS_SbyycSgtF) and [`.reset()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html#/s:8Mixpanel0A8InstanceC5reset10completionyyycSg_tF) methods. Learn more about [identity management](/docs/tracking-methods/id-management/identity-management) and [identifying users](/docs/tracking-methods/id-management/identifying-users).

### Identify

<Callout type="warning">
    We recommend against calling `.identify()` for anonymous visitors to your site.
</Callout>

Call [`.identify()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html#/s:8Mixpanel0A8InstanceC8identify10distinctId9usePeople10completionySS_SbyycSgtF) when you know the identity of the current user, passing in their user ID as an argument. This is typically at account registration and at log in.

```swift Swift
/// your user signs in and tracks a sign in event
Mixpanel.mainInstance().track(event: "sign in")

/// upon sign in, identify the user with their ID
/// ensure future events sent from the user have distinct_id 12345
Mixpanel.mainInstance().identify(distinctId: "12345");
```


### Call Reset on Logout

Call [`.reset()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html#/s:8Mixpanel0A8InstanceC5reset10completionyyycSg_tF) to clear data attributed to a user when they logout. This will clear the local storage and allows you to handle [multiple users on a single device](/docs/tracking-methods/id-management/identifying-users-simplified#multiple-users-one-device).

**Example Usage**
```swift Swift
/// your user signs out and tracks a log out event
Mixpanel.mainInstance().track(event: "log out")

/// upon logout, call reset to clear local storage
/// new distinct_id is generated for events moving forward
Mixpanel.mainInstance().reset()
```

<Callout type="info">
    Since v2.7.7, Mixpanel stopped using the IFA(ID for Advertisers) as a distinct_id, meaning calls to reset will generate a new random UUID.

    If you want to use IFV(identifierForVendor) as the distinct_id, you can set `MIXPANEL_UNIQUE_DISTINCT_ID` in build settings `Active Compilation Conditions` on the Mixpanel framework target. The IFV will not change when you call `reset`, but will change upon app uninstalls/reinstalls.
</Callout>


## Storing User Profiles

Once your users are identified, create [user profiles](/docs/data-structure/user-profiles) by setting profile properties to describe them. Example profile properties include "name", "email", "company", and any other demographic details about the user.

The Swift SDK provides a few methods for setting profile properties under the [`People`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/People.html) class accessible via [`.people()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html#/s:8Mixpanel0A8InstanceC6peopleAA6PeopleCSgvp). These methods will trigger requests to the [/engage API endpoint](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/profile-set).

### Setting Profile Properties

<Callout type="info">
  You must call `.identify()` before setting profile properties in order to associate the profile properties you set with the target user. If identify is not called, the profile update will be queued for ingestion until an identify call is made.
</Callout>

You can set properties on a user profile with [`people.set(property:to:)`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/People.html#/s:FC8Mixpanel6People3setFT8propertySS2toPs9AnyObject__T_).

If a profile property already exist, if will be overwritten with the latest value provided in the method. If a profile property does not exist, it will be added to the profile.

**Example Usage**
```swift Swift
/// You must call identify to associate the profile update with the user
Mixpanel.mainInstance().identify(distinctId: "12345")

/// Set user's "Plan" profile prop to "Premium"
Mixpanel.mainInstance().people.set(properties: ["plan":"Premium", "$email":"joe.doe@example.com"])

/// Update "plan" to "Enterprise"
Mixpanel.mainInstance().people.set(properties: ["plan":"Enterprise"])
```

### Other Types of Profile Updates
There are a few other methods for setting profile properties. See a complete reference of the available methods [here](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/People.html)

A few commonly used people methods are highlighted below:

<Tabs items={['setOnce()', 'append()', 'union()','increment()']} >
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The [`setOnce(properties:)`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/People.html#/s:8Mixpanel6PeopleC7setOnce10propertiesySDySSAA0A4Type_pG_tF) method set profile properties only if they do not exist yet. If it is setting a profile property that already exists, it will be ignored.

    Use this method if you want to set profile properties without the risk of overwriting existing data.

    **Example Usage**
    ```swift Swift
    /// set profile properties for user "12345"
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().identify(distinctId: "12345")
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().people.set(properties: ["name":"Sam"])

    /// will be ignored since "name" already exists
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().people.setOnce(properties: ["name":"Samantha"])

    /// set "location" property since it does not exist
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().people.setOnce(properties: ["location":"us"])
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The [`append(properties:)`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/People.html#/s:8Mixpanel6PeopleC6append10propertiesySDySSAA0A4Type_pG_tF) method append values to a list profile property.

    Use this method to add additional values to an existing list property instead of redefining the entire list.

    **Example Usage**
    ```swift Swift
    /// set profile properties for user "12345"
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().identify(distinctId: "12345")
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().people.set(properties: [
        "roles":["sales","engineer"]
        ])


    /// add "legal" to "roles"
    /// new "roles" values are ['sales','engineer','legal']
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().people.append(properties: [
        "roles":"legal"
        ])
    
    /// append() allows duplicates
    // new "roles" values are ['sales','engineer','legal','legal']
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().people.append(properties: [
        "roles":"legal"
        ])
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The [`union(properties:)`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/People.html#/s:8Mixpanel6PeopleC5union10propertiesySDySSAA0A4Type_pG_tF) method append new values to a list property, excluding duplicates.

    Use this method to create a list profile property that only contains unique values without duplicates.

    **Example Usage**
    ```swift Swift
    /// set profile properties for user "12345"
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().identify(distinctId: "12345")
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().people.set(properties: [
        "roles":["sales","engineer"]
        ])

    /// will be ignored since "engineer" already exists in "roles"
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().people.union(properties: [
        "roles":"engineer"
        ])
    
    /// add "legal" to "roles"
    /// "roles" = ['sales','engineer','engineer']
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().people.union(properties: [
        "roles":"legal"
        ])
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The [`increment(property:by:)`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/People.html#/s:8Mixpanel6PeopleC9increment8property2byySS_SdtF) method increments a numeric property by a whole number.

    Use this method to add to or subtract from your numeric property based on its current value.

    **Example Usage**
    ```swift Swift
    /// set profile properties for user "12345"
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().identify(distinctId: "12345")
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().people.set(properties: ["age":25])

    /// increment "age" by 2
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().people.increment(property: "age", by: 2)

    /// use negative number to decrement
    /// decrement "age" by 5
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().people.increment(property: "age", by: -5)
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>


## Group Analytics

<Callout type="info">
    Read more about [Group Analytics](/docs/data-structure/group-analytics) before proceeding. You will need to have the [group key defined in your project settings](/docs/data-structure/group-analytics#group-keys-in-project-settings) first.
</Callout>

Mixpanel Group Analytics is a paid add-on that allows behavioral data analysis by selected groups, as opposed to individual users.

A group is identified by the `group_key` and `group_id`.
* `group_key` is the event property that connects event data to a group. (e.g. `company`)
* `group_id` is the identifier for a specific group. (e.g. `mixpanel`,`company_a`,`company_b`, etc.)

The Swift SDK provides a few method for adding individual users to a group and setting group profile properties.

### Adding Users to a Group

[All events must have the group key as an event property in order to be attributed to a group](/docs/data-structure/group-analytics#group-keys-tracked-as-event-properties). Without the group key, an event cannot be attributed to a group.

Call the [`setGroup(groupKey:groupIDs:)`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html#/s:8Mixpanel0A8InstanceC8setGroup8groupKey0E2IDySS_AA0A4Type_ptF) to register the current user to a group, which would add the `group_key` as an event property set to the `group_id` value to all events moving forward.

**Example Usage**
```swift Swift
/// assign the current user to the "mixpanel" company group
Mixpanel.mainInstance().setGroup(groupKey: "company", groupID: ["mixpanel"])

/// track "some_event"
/// event prop "company" = ["mixpanel"] is added automatically
Mixpanel.mainInstance().track(event: "some_event")


/// alternatively you can define the group key manually
Mixpanel.mainInstance().track(event: "some_event", properties: [
    "company": ["mixpanel"]])
```

**Multiple Groups**

[An event can be attributed to multiple groups](/docs/data-structure/group-analytics#attribute-events-to-multiple-groups) by passing in the `group_key` value as a list of multiple `group_id` values.

Call [`addGroup(groupKey:groupID:)`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html#/s:8Mixpanel0A8InstanceC8addGroup8groupKey0E2IDySS_AA0A4Type_ptF) to add additional `group_id`s to an existing group key property.

**Example Usage**
```swift Swift
/// assign the current user to the "mixpanel" company group
Mixpanel.mainInstance().setGroup(groupKey: "company", groupID: ["mixpanel"])

/// add "mp-us" as an additional company group
Mixpanel.mainInstance().addGroup(groupKey: "company", groupID: "mp-us")

/// track "some_event"
/// event prop "company" = ["mixpanel","mp-us"] is added automatically
Mixpanel.mainInstance().track(event: "some_event")

```

### Adding Group Identifiers to User Profiles

To connect group information to a user profile, include the `group_key` and `group_id` as a user profile property using the `.people.set()` call.

**Example Usage**

```swift Swift
/// You must call identify to associate the profile update with the user
Mixpanel.mainInstance().identify(distinctId: "12345")

/// set group key "company" as a user prop
/// with group id "mixpanel" as value
Mixpanel.mainInstance().people.set(properties: ["company":"mixpanel", "$email":"joe.doe@example.com"])

```

### Setting Group Profile Properties
Create a group profiles by setting group properties, similar to a user profile. For example, you may want to describe a company group with properties such as "ARR", "employee_count", and "subscription".

To set group profile properties, specify the group that needs to be updated by calling [`getGroup(groupKey:groupID:)`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html#/s:8Mixpanel0A8InstanceC8getGroup8groupKey0E2IDAA0D0CSS_AA0A4Type_ptF), then set the group properties by chaining the [`set(properties:)`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/Group.html#/s:8Mixpanel5GroupC3set10propertiesySDySSAA0A4Type_pG_tF) method, which will trigger a request to the [/groups API endpoint](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/group-set-property).

**Example Usage**
```swift Swift
/// assign the current user to the "mixpanel" company group
Mixpanel.mainInstance().setGroup(groupKey: "company", groupID: ["mixpanel"])

/// specify the target group using the group_key and group_id using getGroup()
/// set "industry" as a group profile prop to "analytics" using set()
Mixpanel.mainInstance().getGroup(groupKey: "Company", groupID: “mixpanel”).set(properties: [
    "industry": "analytics"
])
```

### Other Group Profile Methods

See all of the methods under the MixpanelGroup class [here](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/Group.html).

A few commonly used group methods are highlighted below:

<Tabs items={['setOnce()', 'unset()', 'union()','remove()']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The [`setOnce(properties:)`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/Group.html#/s:8Mixpanel5GroupC7setOnce10propertiesySDySSAA0A4Type_pG_tF) method set group profile properties only if they do not exist yet. If it is setting a profile property that already exists, it will be ignored.

    Use this method if you want to set group profile properties without the risk of overwriting existing data.

    **Example Usage**
    ```swift Swift
    /// assign the current user to the "mixpanel" company group
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().setGroup(groupKey: "company", groupID: ["mixpanel"])

    /// set group profile properties
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().getGroup(groupKey: "company", groupID: “mixpanel”).set(properties: [
        "name": "Mixpanel"])

    /// ignored since "name" is already exists
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().getGroup(groupKey: "company", groupID: “mixpanel”).setOnce(properties: [
        "name": "mp"])
    
    /// set "country" group prop since it does not exist
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().getGroup(groupKey: "company", groupID: “mixpanel”).setOnce(properties: [
        "country": "us"])
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The [`unset(property:)`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/Group.html#/s:8Mixpanel5GroupC5unset8propertyySS_tF) method removes a group property from a group profile.

    Use this method to delete unwanted group profile properties from a specific group profile.

    **Example Usage**
    ```swift Swift
    /// assign the current user to the "mixpanel" company group
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().setGroup(groupKey: "company", groupID: ["mixpanel"])

    /// set group profile properties
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().getGroup(groupKey: "company", groupID: “mixpanel”).set(properties: [
        "name": "Mixpanel",
        "employee_count": 100
    ])

    /// delete "employee_count" from the group profile
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().getGroup(groupKey: "company", groupID: “mixpanel”).unset(properties: "employee_count")

    /// The group only has the "name" property remaining
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The [`union(key:values:)`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/Group.html#/s:8Mixpanel5GroupC5union3key6valuesySS_SayAA0A4Type_pGtF) method append new values to a list property, excluding duplicates.

    Use this method to create a list profile property that only contains unique values without duplicates.

    **Example Usage**
    ```swift Swift
    /// assign the current user to the "mixpanel" company group
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().setGroup(groupKey: "company", groupID: ["mixpanel"])

    /// set group profile properties
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().getGroup(groupKey: "company", groupID: “mixpanel”).set(properties: [
        "name": "Mixpanel",
        "features": ["reports","alerts","cohorts"]
    ])

    /// add "data pipeline" to "features" prop
    /// ignore "alert" since it is a duplicate value
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().getGroup(groupKey: "company", groupID: “mixpanel”).union(key: "features",
        values: ["data pipeline","alerts"])
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The [`remove(key:value:)`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/Group.html#/s:8Mixpanel5GroupC6remove3key5valueySS_AA0A4Type_ptF) method removes a value from a list-valued group profile property.

    Use this method to remove specific values from a list without affecting all of the other values in the list.

    **Example Usage**
    ```swift Swift
    /// assign the current user to the "mixpanel" company group
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().setGroup(groupKey: "company", groupID: ["mixpanel"])

    /// set group profile properties
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().getGroup(groupKey: "company", groupID: “mixpanel”).set(properties: [
        "name": "Mixpanel",
        "features": ["reports","alerts","cohorts"]
    ])

    /// remove "alerts" from "features"
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().getGroup(groupKey: "company", groupID: “mixpanel”).remove(
        key: "features", value: "alerts")
    
    /// "features" = ["reports","cohorts"]
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Debugging and Logging

Enable debug mode by setting the [`loggingEnabled`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html#/s:8Mixpanel0A8InstanceC14loggingEnabledSbvp) configuration to `true`.

**Example Usage**
```swift Swift
/// enable debug log
Mixpanel.mainInstance().loggingEnabled = true
```

You have control over the data you send to Mixpanel. The Swift SDK provide methods to help you protect user data.

Learn more about [Privacy](/docs/privacy/overview).

### Opt Out of Tracking

The Swift SDK is initialized with tracking enabled by default. Use the [`optOutTracking()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html#/s:8Mixpanel0A8InstanceC14optOutTrackingyyF) method to opt the user out of data tracking and local storage for the current Mixpanel instance.

**Example Usage**
```swift Swift
/// send "some_event"
Mixpanel.mainInstance().track(event: "some_event")

/// opt user out of tracking
/// SDK is prevented from sending any data
Mixpanel.mainInstance().optOutTracking()

/// this track call will not work
Mixpanel.mainInstance().track(event: "some_event")
```

**Opt Out by Default**

You can initialize the library with users opted out of tracking by default using the `optOutTrackingByDefault` configuration in [`initialize()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/Mixpanel.html). Once the user is ready to be tracked, call [`optInTracking()`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html#/s:8Mixpanel0A8InstanceC13optInTracking10distinctId10propertiesySSSg_SDySSAA0A4Type_pGSgtF) to start tracking.

**Example Usage**
```swift Swift
/// create Mixpanel instance with users opt out of tracking by default
/// SDK is prevented from sending data
Mixpanel.initialize(token: "YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN", 
    outOutTrackingByDefault: true)

/// this track call will not work
Mixpanel.mainInstance().track(event: "some_event")

///opt user into tracking
Mixpanel.mainInstance().optInTracking()

/// send "some_event"
Mixpanel.mainInstance().track(event: "some_event")
```

### EU Data Residency

Route data to Mixpanel's EU servers by setting the `serverURL` property after initializing the client. 

**Example Usage**
```swift Swift
/// initialize Mixpanel
Mixpanel.initialize(token: "MIXPANEL_TOKEN")

/// Set request URL to Mixpanel's EU domain
Mixpanel.mainInstance().serverURL = "https://api-eu.mixpanel.com"
```

### India Data Residency

Route data to Mixpanel's India servers by setting the `serverURL` property after initializing the client. 

**Example Usage**
```swift Swift
/// initialize Mixpanel
Mixpanel.initialize(token: "MIXPANEL_TOKEN")

/// Set request URL to Mixpanel's India domain
Mixpanel.mainInstance().serverURL = "https://api-in.mixpanel.com"
```

### Disable Geolocation

The Swift SDK parse the request IP address to generate geolocation properties for events and profiles. To disable geolocation, set the [`useIPAddressForGeoLocation`](https://mixpanel.github.io/mixpanel-swift/Classes/MixpanelInstance.html#/s:8Mixpanel0A8InstanceC26useIPAddressForGeoLocationSbvp) flag to `false`.

**Example Usage**
```swift Swift
/// initialize Mixpanel
Mixpanel.initialize(token: "MIXPANEL_TOKEN")

/// Set request URL to Mixpanel's EU domain
Mixpanel.mainInstance().useIPAddressForGeoLocation = false
```

## Legacy Automatically Tracked Events

Mixpanel's SDKs have a legacy feature to automatically collect common mobile events. We don't recommend enabling this, as these events rely on client-side state and can be unreliable.

Ensure autotracked mobile events are disabled by setting `trackAutomaticEvents` to `false` during initialization.

**Example Usage**
```swift Swift
// initialize Mixpanel with autotrack disabled
Mixpanel.initialize(token: "YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN",
        trackAutomaticEvents: false,)
```

| Raw Name | Display Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $ae_first_open | First App Open | Tracks the first time the user has opened the app. This event is retriggered if the user reinstalls the app or clears local storage. A user property First App Open Date (`$ae_first_app_open_date`) is tracked to indicate the date when app was first opened. |
| $ae_updated | App Updated | Executes when a user updates the app from the previous version. A Version Updated (`$ae_updated_version`) property is tracked to store the new app version. |
| $ae_session | App Session | Executes when a user spends more than 10 seconds in the app. A Session Length (`$ae_session_length`) property is tracked to reflect the number of seconds user spent in the session. In addition, there are two user properties tracked: Total App Sessions (`$ae_total_app_sessions`) and Total App Session Length (`$ae_total_app_session_length`). |
| $ae_iap | In App Purchase (IAP) | Executes when a user conducts an in-app purchase through your app. Mixpanel provides three properties for this event: Product Name (`$ae_iap_name`), Product Quantity (`$ae_iap_quantity`), and Product Price (`$ae_iap_price`). |
