# Implement Feature Flags (Swift)

## Overview

This developer guide will assist you in configuring your iOS/macOS platform for Feature Flags using the [Mixpanel Swift SDK](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/swift). Feature Flags allow you to control the rollout of your features, conduct A/B testing, and manage application behavior without deploying new code.

For complete Swift SDK documentation, see the [Swift SDK guide](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/swift).

## Prerequisites

Before implementing Feature Flags, ensure:

- You are on an Enterprise subscription plan and have the latest version of the SDK installed (minimum supported version is [`v5.1.3`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-swift/releases/tag/v5.1.3)). If not, please follow [this doc](/docs/quickstart/install-mixpanel) to install the SDK.
- You have your Project Token from your [Mixpanel Project Settings](/docs/orgs-and-projects/managing-projects#find-your-project-tokens)

## Flag Initialization

Initializing the SDK with feature flags enabled requires setting the `featureFlagsEnabled` option to `true`. This enables making an outbound request to Mixpanel servers with the current user context.
The server will assign the user context to a variant for each feature flag according to how they are configured in the Mixpanel UX.

The response will include an assigned variant for each flag that the user context is in a rollout group for. If a flag is not returned, it most likely signifies that the user was either not in the rollout percentage for a flag or in the configured targeting cohort.

**Example Usage**

```swift
Mixpanel.initialize(token: "YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN", options: MixpanelOptions(
    featureFlagsEnabled: true
))
```

If your flag is configured with a Variant Assignment Key other than `distinct_id` for any of the feature flags in your project, then the call to initialize feature flags must include those keys.

For example, for a Variant Assignment Key, `company_id`, you would setup the SDK as follows:

```swift
let options = MixpanelOptions(
    featureFlagsEnabled: true,
    featureFlagsContext: [
        "company_id": "X"
    ]
)
Mixpanel.initialize(token: "YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN", options: options)
```

If you are using Runtime Targeting in any of the feature flags in your project, then any properties that you use in targeting should be included in a `customProperties` node within the context:

```swift
let options = MixpanelOptions(
    featureFlagsEnabled: true,
    featureFlagsContext: [
        "company_id": "X",
        "customProperties": [
            "platform": "ios"
        ]
    ]
)
Mixpanel.initialize(token: "YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN", options: options)
```

## Flag Reload

Following initialization, you can reload feature flag assignments in a couple of ways:

1) After a user logs in or out of your application and you call `identify`, a feature flag reload will be triggered.

```swift
let updatedDistinctId = ""
Mixpanel.mainInstance().identify(distinctId: updatedDistinctId)
```

2) If variant assignment keys or properties used in Runtime Targeting change during the lifetime of your application, you can manually reload flags by updating the context:

```swift
Mixpanel.mainInstance().flags.loadFlags()
```

## Flag Evaluation

Lookup the assigned value for a feature flag.
This action triggers tracking an exposure event, `$experiment_started` to your Mixpanel project.

### Asynchronous Flag Variant Retrieval

**Experiment Flags: Get Variant Value**

```swift
// Get just the flag value asynchronously
Mixpanel.mainInstance().flags.getVariantValue("my-feature-flag", fallbackValue: "control") { value in
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        // Use flag value in your application logic
        if let stringValue = value as? String {
            switch stringValue {
            case "variant_a":
                showExperienceForVariantA()
            case "variant_b":
                showExperienceForVariantB()
            default:
                showDefaultExperience()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**FeatureGates: Check if Flag is Enabled/Disabled**

```swift
// Check if a boolean flag is enabled asynchronously
Mixpanel.mainInstance().flags.isEnabled("my-boolean-flag", fallbackValue: false) { isEnabled in
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        if isEnabled {
            showNewFeature()
        } else {
            showOldFeature()
        }
    }
}
```

### Synchronous Flag Variant Retrieval

**Experiment Flags: Get Variant Value**

```swift
// Get just the flag value synchronously
let flagValue = Mixpanel.mainInstance().flags.getVariantValueSync("my-feature-flag", fallbackValue: "control")

// Use flag value in your application logic
if flagValue as? String == "variant_a" {
    showExperienceForVariantA()
} else if flagValue as? String == "variant_b" {
    showExperienceForVariantB()
} else {
    showDefaultExperience()
}
```

**Feature Gates: Check if Flag is Enabled/Disabled**
```swift
// Check if a boolean flag is enabled
let isEnabled = Mixpanel.mainInstance().flags.isEnabledSync("my-boolean-flag", fallbackValue: false)

if isEnabled {
    showNewFeature()
} else {
    showOldFeature()
}
```


## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if I'm not receiving any flags on SDK initialization?

1. **Check your project token**:
  - Ensure you're using the correct project token from your [Mixpanel project settings](/docs/orgs-and-projects/managing-projects#find-your-project-tokens)
2. **Review flag configuration**:
  - Make sure your feature flag is enabled
  - Check the flag's rollout percentage
    - User contexts that are not assigned to the rollout percentage will not receive flags
  - If you are using a targeting cohort, verify on the mixpanel 'Users' page that the user's `distinct_id` is a member of that cohort.

3. **Review SDK parameters**:
  - Ensure `featureFlagsEnabled: true` is included in the MixpanelOptions
  - If using a custom Variant Assignment Key, ensure it is included in the `featureFlagsContext`
  - If using Runtime Targeting, ensure all properties used in targeting are included in the `customProperties` object within `featureFlagsContext`

4. **Check flags readiness**: Use `areFlagsReady()` to check if flags have been loaded before making synchronous calls
5. **Enable debug mode**: Set up logging to see detailed information about flag requests and responses
