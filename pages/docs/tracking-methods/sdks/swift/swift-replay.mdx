</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
Since our Beta program offers early access, some functionality, including data masking features, may contain bugs and cause crashes. We recommend thoroughly testing before enabling in production.

Our Session Replay Beta Service Addendum can be found [here](https://mixpanel.com/legal/session-replay-beta-service-addendum/).
</Callout>

## Getting started

The Session Replay SDK for Swift is an supplementary SDK that complements the [main Swift SDK](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/swift), enabling you to visually replay your users' app interactions through the [Session Replay](/docs/session-replay) feature. Please refer to our [developer guide on implementing Session Replay](/docs/session-replay/implement-session-replay/session-replay-ios) for a detailed walkthrough.

If you have not installed the main Swift SDK yet, navigate to the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/quickstart).

The [Library Source Code](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-ios-session-replay-package) is documented in our GitHub repo.

## Installing the Library

Add the Session Replay SDK for Swift using Swift Package Manager directly in Xcode:

1. In Xcode, go to File → **Add Package Dependencies…**
2. Paste the GitHub URL: `https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-ios-session-replay-package`
3. Follow the prompts to select the latest version and add the package to your project.

### Initialize

You should have the main Mixpanel Swift SDK installed (minimum version `v4.3.1`). If not, please refer to the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/quickstart). 

**SwiftUI**

```swift Swift
import Mixpanel
import MixpanelSessionReplay
 
struct SessionReplayDemoApp: App {
    @State private var isActive = true
    @Environment(\\.scenePhase) private var scenePhase
 
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ...
        }
        .onChange(of: scenePhase) {
            if scenePhase == .active {
                let config = MPSessionReplayConfig(wifiOnly: false, recordSessionsPercent: 100.0)
                let sessionReplayInstance = MPSessionReplay.initialize(token: Mixpanel.mainInstance().apiToken, distinctId: Mixpanel.mainInstance().distinctId, config: config)
 
                sessionReplayInstance.loggingEnabled = true
                sessionReplayInstance.startRecording()
            }
        }
}
```

**UIKit**

```swift Swift
import Foundation
import UIKit
 
import Mixpanel
import MixpanelSessionReplay
 
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
 
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]? = nil) -> Bool {
        Mixpanel.initialize(token: token, trackAutomaticEvents: true)
 
        let config = MPSessionReplayConfig(
            wifiOnly: false,
            recordSessionsPercent: 100.0
        )
        let sesionReplayInstance = MPSessionReplay.initialize(
            token: Mixpanel.mainInstance().apiToken,
            distinctId: Mixpanel.mainInstance().distinctId,
            config: config
        )
        #if DEBUG
        Mixpanel.mainInstance().loggingEnabled = true
        MPSessionReplay.getInstance()?.loggingEnabled = true
				#endif
        return true
    }
 
    func applicationDidBecomeActive(_ application: UIApplication) {
        MPSessionReplay.getInstance()?.startRecording()
    }
 
}
```

## Capturing Replays

<Callout type="warning">
	Test in a sandbox project and start with a smaller sample rate. This allows you to monitor performance, usage, and ensure your privacy rules align with your company policies.
</Callout>

You can capturing replay data using a sampling method (recommended), or customize when and where replays are captured manually using methods provided by the Session Replay Swift SDK.

### Sampling

To enable Session Replay and set your sampling rate, use the [`SessionReplayConfig`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-ios-session-replay/blob/e3d9edd6c68fc027b5217ef42dd2bd0234b8262e/MixpanelSessionReplay/MixpanelSessionReplay/Models/MPSessionReplayConfig.swift#L26) object and set [`recordSessionsPercent`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-ios-session-replay/blob/e3d9edd6c68fc027b5217ef42dd2bd0234b8262e/MixpanelSessionReplay/MixpanelSessionReplay/Models/MPSessionReplayConfig.swift#L42) with a value between `0.0` and `100.0`. 

At `0.0` no sessions will be recorded, at `100.0` all sessions will be recorded.

**Example Usage**

```swift Swift
// records 1% of all sessions
MPSessionReplayConfig(recordSessionsPercent: 1.0)
```

### Manual Capture

To programatically start and stop replay capture, use the `.startRecording()` and `.stopRecording()` methods.

#### Start Recording

Call [`.startRecording()`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-ios-session-replay/blob/e3d9edd6c68fc027b5217ef42dd2bd0234b8262e/MixpanelSessionReplay/MixpanelSessionReplay/MPSessionReplayInstance.swift#L123) to force recording to begin, regardless of the `recordSessionsPercent` init option. 

The recording automatically stops when the app goes to the background. Therefore, if you want to continuously record the replays, you will need to restart the replay once the app becomes active again.

**Example Usage**

```swift Swift
// manually trigger a replay capture
MPSessionReplay.getInstance()?.startRecording()
// no effect if recording is already in progress
```

#### Stop Recording

Call [`.stopRecording()`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-ios-session-replay/blob/e3d9edd6c68fc027b5217ef42dd2bd0234b8262e/MixpanelSessionReplay/MixpanelSessionReplay/MPSessionReplayInstance.swift#L218) to stop any active replay data collection. The SDK automatically stops recording when the app goes to the background.

**Example Usage**

```swift Swift
// manually end a replay capture
MPSessionReplay.getInstance()?.stopRecording()
// no effect if recording is not already in progress
```

### Config Options

Upon initialization you can provide a [`SessionReplayConfig`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-ios-session-replay/blob/e3d9edd6c68fc027b5217ef42dd2bd0234b8262e/MixpanelSessionReplay/MixpanelSessionReplay/Models/MPSessionReplayConfig.swift#L26) object to customize your replay capture behavior.

Currently, there are four config options:

| Option | Description | Default | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`wifiOnly`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-ios-session-replay/blob/e3d9edd6c68fc027b5217ef42dd2bd0234b8262e/MixpanelSessionReplay/MixpanelSessionReplay/Models/MPSessionReplayConfig.swift#L34) | When `true`, replay events will only be flushed to the server when the device has a WiFi connection. If there is no wifi, flushes are skipped and the events remain in the in-memory queue until wifi is restored (or until the queue reaches its limit and the oldest events are evicted to make room for newer events). <br/> When `false`, replay events will be flushed with any network connection, including cellular. | `true` |
| [`recordSessionsPercent`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-ios-session-replay/blob/e3d9edd6c68fc027b5217ef42dd2bd0234b8262e/MixpanelSessionReplay/MixpanelSessionReplay/Models/MPSessionReplayConfig.swift#L42) | This is a value between `0.0` and `100.0` that controls the sampling rate for recording session replays. <br/> At `0.0` no sessions will be recorded. At `100.0` all sessions will be recorded.  | `0.0` |
| [`autoMaskedViews`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-ios-session-replay/blob/e3d9edd6c68fc027b5217ef42dd2bd0234b8262e/MixpanelSessionReplay/MixpanelSessionReplay/Models/MPSessionReplayConfig.swift#L47) | This is a `Set` of enum options for the types of views that should be masked by the SDK automatically. | `Image`, `Text`, and `Web` |
| [`autoCapture`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-ios-session-replay/blob/e3d9edd6c68fc027b5217ef42dd2bd0234b8262e/MixpanelSessionReplay/MixpanelSessionReplay/Models/MPSessionReplayConfig.swift#L57) | This an enum to selectively disable the runtime method replacement functionality (aka “swizzling") in the event that it conflicts with another SDK (like [New Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/get-started/new-relic-ios-compatibility-requirements/#method)) | `.enabled` |

**Example Usage**

```swift Swift
// mask images only
// only send recordings on wifi
MPSessionReplayConfig(autoMaskedViews: [.Image], wifiOnly: true)
```

#### Manual Screenshot Capture

If you have partially or completely disabled automatic screen capture via the `autoCapture` config setting above, you can manually capture screenshots by calling [`.captureScreenshot()`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-ios-session-replay/blob/e3d9edd6c68fc027b5217ef42dd2bd0234b8262e/MixpanelSessionReplay/MixpanelSessionReplay/MPSessionReplayInstance.swift#L151):

**Example Usage**

```swift Swift
// manually capture screenshots
MPSessionReplay.getInstance()?.captureScreenshot()

// manually capture screenshots triggered by a touch event
MPSessionReplay.getInstance()?.captureScreenshot(withTouchEvent: touchEvent)
```

If you choose to disable auto capture and do manual screen capturing instead, it will be up to you to determine when, where and how you call the `.captureScreenshot()` method in your application. The most naïve approach would be to call it on a `Timer`.

**Example Usage**

```swift Swift
// trigger manual screenshot capture using Timer
let screenshotTimer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 1, repeats: true) { _ in
    MPSessionReplay.getInstance()?.captureScreenshot()
}
```

Keeping in mind that this is relatively inefficient and will result in capturing unnecessary/unchanged screenshots, it is also possible to miss important moments in between the timed screenshots.

### Mark Views as Sensitive

Mark any views as sensitive by setting `mpReplaySensitive` to `true`. Views marked as "sensitive" will be masked. 

Set `mpReplaySensitive` to `false` to mark any view as safe. Views marked as "safe" will not be masked.

**Example Usage**

```swift Swift
// Mark any view as sensitive

// SwiftUI
Image("family photo")
	.mpReplaySensitive(true)
 
// UIKit
let ccView = CreditCardUIView()
ccView.mpReplaySensitive = true
```

All `UITextField` and `UILabel` components are masked by default. `UITextField` cannot be unmasked, while `UILabels` can be unmasked

## Get Replay ID

Use the [`getReplayId()`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-ios-session-replay/blob/2fb5c4651fa7bd661395082d5350565401ed26f7/MixpanelSessionReplay/MixpanelSessionReplay/MPSessionReplay.swift#L19) method to return the [Replay ID](/docs/session-replay/implement-session-replay/session-replay-ios#replay-id) for the current replay recording. The method will return an empty object if there is no active replay capture in progress.

**Example Usage**

```swift Swift
// return the $mp_replay_id for the currently active capture
MPSessionReplay.getInstance()?.getReplayId()
// {$mp_replay_id: '19221397401184-063a51e0c3d58d-17525637-1d73c0-1919139740f185'}
```

## Flushing

Use the [`flush()`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-ios-session-replay/blob/e3d9edd6c68fc027b5217ef42dd2bd0234b8262e/MixpanelSessionReplay/MixpanelSessionReplay/MPSessionReplayInstance.swift#L255) method to manually flush replay events in queue.

```swift Swift
// trigger manual flushing for replay events
MPSessionReplay.getInstance()?.flush()
```

## Debug Mode

Enable or disable logging with the [`loggingEnabled`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-ios-session-replay/blob/e3d9edd6c68fc027b5217ef42dd2bd0234b8262e/MixpanelSessionReplay/MixpanelSessionReplay/MPSessionReplayInstance.swift#L52) property of the [`MPSessionReplay`](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-ios-session-replay/blob/e3d9edd6c68fc027b5217ef42dd2bd0234b8262e/MixpanelSessionReplay/MixpanelSessionReplay/MPSessionReplayInstance.swift) object.

**Example Usage**

```swift Swift
let token = Mixpanel.mainInstance().apiToken
let distinctId = Mixpanel.mainInstance().distinctId
let config = MPSessionReplayConfig(wifiOnly: false, recordSessionsPercent: 50.0)
let sessionReplayInstance = MPSessionReplay.initialize(token: token, distinctId: distinctId, config: config)
sessionReplayInstance.loggingEnabled = true // enable debug log
```

## Replay Retention

User replays are stored for 30 days after the time of ingestion.
