This document will walk you through step-by-step instructions to get your BigQuery connector up and running.

### 1. Connect to your Warehouse

Complete the following steps:

1. Navigate to **Project Settings**, then select **Warehouse Sources**.
2. Click on `+ Add Connection` and select BigQuery.
3. You should see a new page to create your BigQuery connector. In the first view, fill out the required field **GCP Project ID**. 
    - Run the commands below in Cloud shell & click  `Create Source`
    
    ```jsx
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <your_gcp_project_id> \
    --member serviceAccount:project-2946576@mixpanel-warehouse-1.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role roles/bigquery.dataViewer
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <your_gcp_project_id> \
    --member serviceAccount:project-2946576@mixpanel-warehouse-1.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role roles/bigquery.jobUser
    ```
    
4. In the second view, you should see that the credentials are validated and a source is added. 


### 2. Format Data for Mixpanel Ingestion


To import data from a warehouse directly, make sure the tables are formatted correctly.

Each column in the table will be mapped as a property on the event. 

Read more about best practices for tracking Events and Properties in Mixpanel [here](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking/how-tos/events-and-properties). 

**The following columns are required:** 

- Event Time
- Distinct ID
- Insert ID
    - This is an optional field, but we recommend it as a best practice in case duplicate events need to be reconciled.
- Insert Time
    - We expect this to be a monotonically increasing TIMESTAMP_NTZ. We use this as a water mark to figure out which events are new and ingest them.
- Event Name
    - You can specify the column that has this value.
    - Alternatively, you can specify a static value during creation.

### 3. Send Events

Once you have created a warehouse source, follow the below steps to send events into Mixpanel.
1. Go to Project Settings > Warehouse Data.
2. Click on + Add Warehouse Event.
3. Select the BigQuery as source from the dropdown.
4. Select the Dataset.
5. Select the Table.
6. Specify the Event Name:
    - You can specify the column which has the event name.
    - **OR** You can specify the event name for all the events.
7. Specify the Event Time:
    - This is the time the event occurred.
8. Select the column to be used for Insert ID.
9. Identity Management:
    - If your project has **Simplified ID Merge**, the warehouse connector will prompt you to map the $device_id and $user_id properties to columns in your table during setup. For more information on how we map those fields to the resulting distinct id, refer to our documentation [here](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking/how-tos/identifying-users#usage).
    - If your project has **Original ID Merge**, the warehouse connector will prompt you to map the Distinct ID column. This column represents the entity to which the events belong; it could be a user or a device. If you want to map two entities together you have to additionally call either $identify, $merge, $alias functions, along with their corresponding properties. For more information, refer to our documentation [here](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking/how-tos/identifying-users#how-does-the-simplified-api-differ-from-the-original-api) 
10. Check the preview to ensure that everything looks correct, and then create the event.
