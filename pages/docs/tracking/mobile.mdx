## Step 1: Install the SDK
<Tabs items={['React Native', 'Flutter', 'iOS (Objective-C)', 'iOS (Swift)', 'Android', 'Unity']}>

<Tab>
Under your app's root directory, run:

```
npm install mixpanel-react-native
```

Under your application's iOS folder, run:

```
pod install
```

Note: For XCode 12.5+, there is a known compile issue, please refer to this [workaround](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-react-native/issues/43#issuecomment-829599732).
</Tab>
<Tab>
Add `mixpanel_flutter: ^2.0.0` to your package's pubspec.yaml file and run:
```
flutter pub get
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
**Swift Package Manager**
1.  In Xcode, select File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency.
2.  Follow the prompts using the URL for this repository and must select a version greater than or equal to v4.0.0

**CocoaPods**
1. Create a Podfile in your Xcode project directory by runningÂ `pod init`Â in your terminal, edit the Podfile generated, and add the following line:Â `pod 'Mixpanel'`.
2. RunÂ `pod install`Â in your Xcode project directory. CocoaPods should download and install the Mixpanel library, and create a new Xcode workspace. Open up this workspace in Xcode or typingÂ `open *.xcworkspace`Â in your terminal.

**Carthage**
Add `github "mixpanel/mixpanel-iphone"` to your Cartfile.
</Tab>
<Tab>
**Swift Package Manager (requires Xcode 12+)**
1. In Xcode, select File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency.
2. Paste the URL `https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-swift` and a minimum semantic version of v2.8.0.

**CocoaPods**
1. Create a Podfile in your Xcode project directory by runningÂ `pod init`Â in your terminal, edit the Podfile generated, and add the following line:Â `pod 'Mixpanel-swift'`.
2. RunÂ `pod install`Â in your Xcode project directory. CocoaPods should download and install the Mixpanel library, and create a new Xcode workspace. Open up this workspace in Xcode or typingÂ `open *.xcworkspace`Â in your terminal.

**Carthage**
Add `github "mixpanel/mixpanel-swift"` to your Cartfile.
</Tab>
<Tab>
Add `implementation 'com.mixpanel.android:mixpanel-android:7.+'` as a dependency to your `build.gradle` file.

Once you've updated `build.gradle`, you can force Android Studio to sync with your new configuration by clicking the Sync Project with Gradle Files icon at the top of the window:
![Sync Android With Gradle](https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn-mxpnl-com/static/readme/android-sync-gradle.png)

If it cannot find the dependency, you should make sure you've specified `mavenCentral()` as a repository in `build.gradle`.

Next, add the following permissions in your AndroidManifest.xml:

```java
<!--Required to allow the application to send events to Mixpanel.-->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

<!--Optional, but recommended so we can send data intelligently based on network conditions -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />

<!-- Optional, but recommended so events will contain information about bluetooth state-->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
Add `https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-unity.git#master` to the dependencies section of `com.mixpanel.unity`.

Alternatively, you can download and install the .unitypackage file from our [releases page](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-unity/releases).
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Track your first event
You'll need your Project Token for this, which you can get [here](https://mixpanel.com/settings/project).

<Tabs items={['React Native', 'Flutter', 'iOS (Objective-C)', 'iOS (Swift)', 'Android', 'Unity']}>

<Tab>
```javascript

import React from 'react';
import { Button, SafeAreaView } from "react-native";
import { Mixpanel } from 'mixpanel-react-native';

const trackAutomaticEvents = true;
const mixpanel = new Mixpanel("Your Token", trackAutomaticEvents);
mixpanel.init();

const SampleApp = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <Button
        title="Select Premium Plan"
        onPress={() => mixpanel.track("Signed Up", {"Signup Type": "Referral"})}
      />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}

export default SampleApp;
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```dart
import 'package:mixpanel_flutter/mixpanel_flutter.dart';
class _YourClassState extends State<YourClass> {
  Mixpanel mixpanel;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    initMixpanel();
  }

  Future<void> initMixpanel() async {
    // Replace with your Project Token
    // Once you've called this method once, you can access `mixpanel` throughout the rest of your application.
    mixpanel = await Mixpanel.init("Your Token", trackAutomaticEvents: true);
  }
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```objc
#import "Mixpanel/Mixpanel.h"

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
...
	Mixpanel *mixpanel = [Mixpanel sharedInstanceWithToken:@"YOUR_TOKEN" trackAutomaticEvents: YES];
	[mixpanel track:@"Signed Up" properties:@{
		@"Signup Type": @"Referral"
	}];
...
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
Import Mixpanel into AppDelegate.swift, and initialize Mixpanel within application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:
```swift
import Mixpanel

func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                 didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [NSObject: AnyObject]?) -> Bool {
    ...
    // Replace with your Project Token
    Mixpanel.initialize(token: "Your Token")
    Mixpanel.mainInstance().track(event: "Signed Up", properties: [
        "Signup Type": "Referral", 
    ])
    ...
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```java
import com.mixpanel.android.mpmetrics.MixpanelAPI;

public class MainActivity extends ActionBarActivity {
  private MixpanelAPI mp;

  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

    // Replace with your Project Token
    mp = MixpanelAPI.getInstance(this, "YOUR_TOKEN");
  }

  private void sendToMixpanel() throws JSONException {
    JSONObject props = new JSONObject();
    props.put("Signup Type", "Referral");
    mp.track("Signed Up", props);
  }
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
To initialize the library, first open the unity project settings menu for Mixpanel. (Edit -> Project Settings -> Mixpanel) Then, enter your project token into the Token and Debug Token input fields within the inspector. If you prefer to initialize Mixpanel manually, you can select the `Manual Initialization` in the settings and call `Mixpanel.Init()` to initialize.

Add the following sample code to a part of your application:
```csharp
using  mixpanel;
var props = new Value();
props["Signup Type"] =  "Referral";
Mixpanel.Track('Signup', props);
```
</Tab>

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you've tracked your first event! You can see it in Mixpanel via the [Events](https://mixpanel.com/report/events) page.

For more options, see the reference and code for each SDK in [Github](https://github.com/mixpanel).

## FAQ

### Why aren't my events showing up?
To preserve battery life and customer bandwidth, the Mixpanel library doesn't send the events you record immediately. Instead, it sends batches to the Mixpanel servers every 60 seconds while your application is running, as well as when the application transitions to the background. You can call `.flush()` manually if you want to force a flush at a particular moment for example before your application is completely shutdown. See our [debugging guide](/docs/tracking/how-tos/debugging).

### How do I opt users out of tracking?
Call the `.optOutTracking()` method, which will prevent data from being sent from the userâ€™s device.

### Starting with iOS 14.5, do I need to request the userâ€™s permission through the AppTrackingTransparency framework to use Mixpanel?
No, Mixpanel does not use IDFA so it does not require user permission through the AppTrackingTransparency(ATT) framework.

### If I add Mixpanel tracking to my iOS app, how do I answer app privacy questions for the App Store?
Please refer to our  [Apple App Developer Privacy Guidance](https://mixpanel.com/legal/app-store-privacy-details/)
