# Beyond Onboarding

## Revisiting Onboarding Goals and Objectives
The over arching goals of this onboarding tutorial was to enable you to:
- Hone in on your analytics strategy if you don't already have one
- Help reduce time to impact by guiding you on implementation best practices and then how to start using Mixpanel to answer your questions
- Set you up with data governance best practices to enable you to scale 

Hopefully, you have found this helpful. If you have any feedback on how we can continue to strengthen our tutorials, please drop us a line at success@mixpanel.com.
