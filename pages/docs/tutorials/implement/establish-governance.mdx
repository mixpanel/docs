# Establish Data Governance

Implementing your tracking plan by sending data into Mixpanel and conducting Quality Assurance test is your first step to getting insights about your users' behaviours. Keeping your data in production clean, concise, and consistent as you add more tracking, requires you to establish a data governance framework.

Data governance involves key data stakeholders establishing a methodology, process, or strategy to ensure Mixpanel implementation continues to be consistent, accurate, and trustworthy. It need not be complex, but should focus on the following principles:

Setting up a data governance framework can be as simple as having:

1. **Ownership**: designating an owner or governance team *(eg leads from each business unit Product, Marketing, Analytics, Data Science)* responsible for this task
2. **Standards**: documenting your standards, conventions, taxonomy, and processes for defining metrics / KPIs and instrumenting your tracking plan
3. **Controls**: establishing review and sign-off processes before rolling out to production to maintain data trust

In this tutorial, we'll cover some tools to help you keep up with data governance controls, as well as, tips on how to fix potential data issues that may fall through the cracks.

## Event Approval

Mixpanel's Event Approval feature enables project owners or admins to first review any new events or properties sent to a Mixpanel project before it is released for use. This feature is available to all our [Enterprise Plan](https://mixpanel.com/settings/org/plan) customers.

</p>

You can enable this feature at a project level to receive alerts via e-mail or Slack messages whenever a new event or property is received; thereby, allowing you to take timely appropriate actions. We recommend enabling this for your production project.

## Lexicon Overview and Data Clean Up

For data already existing in Mixpanel, you can also leverage [Lexicon](/docs/data-governance/lexicon), which is what we call our data dictionary, to audit and manage your events, event and user properties, and their corresponding metadata.

We've included some useful statistics to help you dive into your event usage context, such as:
- Who first queried an event and when?
- When was it first tracked?
- Which people queried it most recently and when?
- What is the number of queries in the last 30 days?

For example, in the following image, you can see the total UI and API queries in the last 30 days for any of these data types and sort by it. You can thereby revisit the relevance of events that have a high 30 day volume and low 30 day query volume. Similarly, you could sort the events by last queried time to understand which events have not been queried for an extended period of time.

Such metadata lets you easily discover the parts of your implementation that are most valuable and the parts that are not being used. You can use this information to determine which events you should [drop](/docs/data-governance/lexicon#dropping-events) - i.e. stop sending into Mixpanel. 

In the event where you are seeing a lot of events on Lexicon and you don't have the engineering resources to do a data clean up, Project Owners and Admins can always leverage our Tags feature on Lexicon to group events belonging to a specific user journey (e.g. checkout) or belonging to specific categories such as KPIs. With that, users would be able to easily filter out the events related to the metrics or user journey they are keen to query by selecting the events parked under any of the pre-built “Tags” in any of the core reports.

## Create an Implementation Monitoring Hub in Your Project
You can use the [board template](https://mixpanel.com/s/3oqDsG) you previously saw in the [QA and Audit](/docs/tutorials/implement/qa-data-audit) tutorial as a Monitoring Board going forward. Leverage existing documentation to guide users seamlessly through the transition. Optimize real-time data visibility, ensuring customers harness the full potential of Mixpanel's analytics. Enhance their experience by empowering them to monitor key metrics effortlessly. This course distills complex processes into digestible steps, fostering user independence and maximizing the value of their Mixpanel investment.
