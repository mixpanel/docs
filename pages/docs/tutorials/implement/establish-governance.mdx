# Establish Data Governance

## Lexicon Overview and Data Clean Up

## Overview

[Lexicon](/docs/data-governance/lexicon) is a data dictionary that stores descriptions of all unique events and their corresponding properties. Project owners and admins can add/manage descriptions for all events and properties and organize data for clarity and discoverability. Event and property definitions help your entire team understand what your data means, so everyone is aligned.

###  Event Metadata

Mixpanel’s Event Metadata makes it easier to investigate and fix data discrepancies, with peace of mind that you’re not disrupting your team’s workflows.

You can now see event usage context in Lexicon, such as:
- Who first queried an event? When?
- When was it first tracked?
- Which people queried it most recently? When?
- What is the number of queries in the last 30 days?

In this view, you can see the total UI and API queries in the last 30 days for any of these data types and sort by it. You can thereby revisit the relevance of events that have a high 30 day volume and low 30 day query volume. Similarly, you could sort the events by last queried time to understand which events have not been queried for an extended period of time.

Such metadata lets you easily discover the parts of your implementation that are most valuable and the parts that are not being used. You can use this information to determine which events you should [drop](/docs/data-governance/lexicon#dropping-events). 

### Organising events using Tags on Lexicon

In the event where you are seeing a lot of events on Lexicon and there aren't sufficient engineering resources for your team to do a data clean up, Project Owners and Admins can always leverage on our Tags feature on Lexicon to group events belonging to a specific user journey (e.g. checkout) or belonging to specific categories such as KPIs. With that, users would be able to easily filter out the events related to the metrics or user journey they are keen to query by selecting the events parked under any of the pre-built “Tags” in any of the core reports.

## Events Approval
[Event Approval](/docs/data-governance/event-approval) is a Data Governance feature for organizations that want visibility and control over all new events being sent to their Mixpanel project so as to maintain data trust. The feature is a project-level setting for Enterprise accounts that hides new events by default and notifies admins when those new events come in so they can then mark it as visible for everyone to see. Only events that have been given “stamp of approval” by the admins would be visible to users on the core reports.
