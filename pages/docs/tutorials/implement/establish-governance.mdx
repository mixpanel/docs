# Establish Data Governance
Assuming you've successfully sent in your first events and user properties into Mixpanel, how do you continue to keep your data clean as you add more events? Or as your application changes and you need to hide no longer relevant events? In this tutorial, we guide you in establishing good data governance practices to keep your implementation clean, concise and consistent.

## Events Approval
Our customers with the best data governance do this today, either via our [Event Approval](/docs/data-governance/event-approval) feature, or their internal processes. Essentially, this feature enables project owners or admins to first review any new events that are being sent to their Mixpanel project. They can ensure the proper event naming conventions and clear descriptions are put in place before making these events visible for everyone else in the project.

## Lexicon Overview and Data Clean Up

For data already existing in Mixpanel, you can also leverage [Lexicon](/docs/data-governance/lexicon), which is what we call our data dictionary, to audit and manage your events, event and user properties, and their corresponding metadata.

We've included some useful statistics to help you dive into your event usage context, such as:
- Who first queried an event and when?
- When was it first tracked?
- Which people queried it most recently and when?
- What is the number of queries in the last 30 days?

For example, in the following image, you can see the total UI and API queries in the last 30 days for any of these data types and sort by it. You can thereby revisit the relevance of events that have a high 30 day volume and low 30 day query volume. Similarly, you could sort the events by last queried time to understand which events have not been queried for an extended period of time.

Such metadata lets you easily discover the parts of your implementation that are most valuable and the parts that are not being used. You can use this information to determine which events you should [drop](/docs/data-governance/lexicon#dropping-events) - i.e. stop sending into Mixpanel. 

In the event where you are seeing a lot of events on Lexicon and you don't have the engineering resources to do a data clean up, Project Owners and Admins can always leverage our Tags feature on Lexicon to group events belonging to a specific user journey (e.g. checkout) or belonging to specific categories such as KPIs. With that, users would be able to easily filter out the events related to the metrics or user journey they are keen to query by selecting the events parked under any of the pre-built “Tags” in any of the core reports.
