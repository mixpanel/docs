# Check Your Implementation

As a best practice, we recommend that you minimally setup two Mixpanel projects, one for **Development** data and another for **Production** data. If you have not done so, refer to the [Development and Production Project Setup](/docs/tutorials/plan/setup#development-and-production-project-setup) section.

You should implement and test all your tracking using the development project; and before pushing live data to your production project, you should conduct Quality Assurance (QA) tests to ensure correctness, consistency, and accuracy.

## Quality Assurance

There are generally two levels of Quality Assurance tests that your teams should focus on:

- **Code Level** - involves developers checking on individual event, user / group profile, and property names, as well as, their values for correctness and consistency, by triggering calls and monitoring the results for any errors in the data or errors thrown by the Mixpanel SDKs or APIs.

- **User Flows** - consists of product and data teams navigating through your website / app focusing on testing the key journeys being tracked, and checking on events, user / group profiles, and their properties for accuracy in relation to the entrire journey. Identity management is also a key focus here to ensure users are being correctly identified across devices and platforms.

Mixpanel provides the following tools that enable you to conduct QA:

1. Debug Mode - Mixpanel Client-Side SDKs can be configured to [Enable Debug Mode](docs/debugging/overview#enable-debug-mode) which logs any Mixpanel client-side calls to the browser console or development platforms (eg Xcode, Android Studio). 

   Outside of the Client-Side SDKs, development teams should consider including code to handle error responses thrown by our Server-Side SDKs, APIs, or by the other tools you use to send data to Mixpanel (eg CDP, Revese ETL or Cloud Ingestion scripts). An example would be utilizing code to retry events with an exponential backoff when receiving a 429 rate limited error response.

2. Events report -

Another helpful tool that can be utilized at both the code level and user flows QA is the Events report in the Mixpanel UI. You can utilize the Events report to see events as they flow into your Mixpanel project as well as the properties attached to those events to identify any tracking discrepancies. You can also enable JSON mode on the events to see the raw structure of the underlying data being ingested into Mixpanel.

When conducting User Flows QA, you can also view user profiles to view a user's event feed and user properties. From this view, you can perform the following:

- Examine the identity cluster to see all the Distinct IDs linked to the user
- Search and validate all user properties and their values
- Use the activity feed to search through all events with the most recent one listed on top
- Adjust the date range or selectively hide certain events for easier troubleshooting
- Expand any event to see its event properties
- Click “View in Insights” to do further analysis using our Insights report


Once you have confirmed the cleanliness of your implementation by QAing in your dev environment, you should begin pushing live data into your production environment.
