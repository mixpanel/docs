# Overview

If you have already created your tracking plan and know what you want to track, the next step is to start implementing. However, if you have not done so, it's good to catch-up reading on [Plan](/docs/tutorials/plan/setup) first.

# Send Your Data: Implement Your Tracking Plan

Mixpanel provides a variety of methods to send your data. Depending on your existing infrastructure, availability of development team resources, and the type of data you plan to collect, this section will help guide you in selecting the right ingestion method to implement your tracking plan.

## Choosing an Ingestion Method

When it comes to deciding which ingestion approach to use, there are no fixed rules; and each approach comes with its own advantages and limitations.

  <iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/21afb3020ebe4f38bb760e5d49c68af1?sid=c1528edf-54d5-4af6-98cb-2f715ab801b0" frameborder="0" style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }} allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

Here are the key considerations that would guide you along in choosing the right approach as we go through each one:

- **Source of Truth**: Does your company already have a *"source of truth"* data that is used in reporting?
- **Data Tools**: Do you use any existing Event Streaming, Customer Data Platform (CDP), or Reverse ETL tools?
- **Clickstream Data**: Are you already collecting any clickstream data, and if not, do you have the ability to collect them?
- **Development Team**: What available development resources does your company have to implement the ingestion approaches?

It is important to choose an ingestion method that fits your current needs and available resources, at the same time, factoring for some flexibility in scaling your approach as your product evolves. Most of our customers tend to start with the simplest approach of using our SDKs and slowly migrate to more complex architectures like CDPs or Reverse ETLs.

### Data Warehouse or Reverse ETL

If you currently store data in a data warehouse, this is our recommended method to bring in data into Mixpanel. Our [Warehouse Sync](/docs/tracking-methods/data-warehouse/overview) integration allows you to import both event and user data into your Mixpanel project via recurring syncs to ensure that your data in Mixpanel matches your trusted data source.

<p style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0, overflow: 'hidden' }}>

</p>

Another option to send data from your data warehouse to Mixpanel would be to utilize a Reverse ETL tool. These third-party tools will allow you to make any necessary transformations to the data and set up sync schedules to import data from your warehouse to Mixpanel. Please refer to the respective documentation of whichever reverse ETL tool your team chooses to utilize.

### CDP
If you currently utitilise a Customer Data Platform (CDP), you can also use this to send your data to Mixpanel. If you're switching to Mixpanel from another analytics tool, CDPs will also allow you to easily migrate your historical data into Mixpanel.

</p>

Please refer to the documentation provided by your respective CDP provider for more information on how to connect your CDP to Mixpanel.

### API

If you would like to send data directly to Mixpanel servers without the need of any sort of intermediary layer, you can utilize our Ingestion API to send in [events](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/import-events). and add / update / delete existing [user profiles](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/profile-set).

</p>

### Event Streaming / Cloud Ingestion

If your team already has an existing event stream pipeline, you could use it to send data into  Mixpanel as you receive it.

</p>

### SDKs
We do also support a wide range of SDKs that you can utilize. You can find a list of available client-side SDKs in our [documentation](/docs/tracking-methods/choosing-the-right-method#client-side-tracking).

In general, we recommend utilizing Client-Side SDKs if you have limited development resources, no existing data collection infrastructure, or have no reliable method to track clickstream data. Whilst they might be initially the easiest to set up, ad blockers can impact your ability to track data accurately. Furthermore, it can be difficult to keep metrics consistent when utilizing client-side SDKs across multiple platforms such as across both a website and mobile app.

Alternatively, you may want to consider using Server-Side SDKs, which are not susceptible to ad blockers, and provide more consistency when tracking users across platforms. It does require some custom code to track your anonymous (non-logged in) users.

As an in between, consider tracking Client-Side via a Proxy. This will help [reduce the likelihood of ad-blockers impacting your tracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pv6tmRfqr8), while allowing you to automatically capture certain default client-side actions. For more details, please see [this article](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript#tracking-via-proxy) on how to set up a proxy.

## Identity Management Best practices

As users navigate through your website or application, it is common for them to move from anonymous to identified states, as well as, logged out to logged-in states. 

If you're utilizing our Mixpanel SDKs, especially client-side, you should carefully manage all the identifiers belonging to a user correctly to ensure that all of their pre-auth and post-auth activity is tracked as one user.

In the following video, we walk through how you [identify users](/docs/tracking-methods/identifying-users) in Mixpanel, using the Simplified ID Merge method.

<p style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0, overflow: 'hidden' }}>
  <iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/b0065e1bea294d2b8181205302633923?sid=547419d8-feee-400d-a18f-911f41b41692" frameborder="0" style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }} allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

Do note that the mixpanel.identify() call does not create a User Profile in Mixpanel. The people.set() method is the required call to set user properties on a user profile. However, the people.set() call also requires an identify() call at some point in the same session so that Mixpanel knows which User ID to associate the profile properties to. If there is no identify() call in a userâ€™s session where people.set() is called, we store the profile properties locally until that user hits an identify() call.
