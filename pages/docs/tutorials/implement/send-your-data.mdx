## Choosing an Ingestion Method
to-dos:
- Have the following videos:
    - Choosing the right ingestion method (talk about CDP and recommend referring CDP docs)
    - Sample for Client and server side SDKs
    - API
    - DWH Connectors
    - Cloud ingestion
- General advice on what are the different ways to get data in Mixpanel
- Flowchart or Diagram in video
- Page has links to different types of ingestion  methods

- Add User profiles section on this
    - Ensure we add the part that unless we call people.set() [after identify() in SDKs], profile will not be created.

## Identity Management Best practices
to-do: focus on simplified id + video to talk through

- ensuring that anon events are linked to the right user profile
- What are some of the caveats?
- point links to legacy ID management ( original API and v1)
