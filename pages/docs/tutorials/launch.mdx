## Overview
Once you have your production data in Mixpanel, you can start to create your first Mixpanel Boards and reports. 

## Recommended Boards
We've created a [demo board](https://mixpanel.com/s/ZRRkD) you can copy into your own project to follow along the tutorials in this section. As you open the linked board, you will see instructions to click on "Use this board" to transfer it over to your project and to edit the default date range.
