## Overview
Mixpanelâ€™s Funnels allows you to examine how end-users perform events in a series. Funnels calculate and display the amount of users who convert from one event to another within a particular time window. This allows you to identify where your users drop off, what segments convert the most, and other important facets of the user journey.

## Configuring Conversion Criteria
Conversion Critera allows you to define how much time a user has to convert through all steps of the funnel after entering it and also determine how many times Mixpanel should count a particular user's activity towards your conversion rates.

## Advanced Funnel Features
Go beyond looking at overall conversion, view conversion trend over time, distribution of the time it takes users to convert through the funnel or the number of times users complete any step before converting or dropping off. Add more specificity to your conversion criteria by holding a property constant over steps or exlcude users who did a particular event.

## Viewing as a Flow
You can see what flows or behaviors can increase the likelihood of conversion or drop-off by viewing the funnel as a Flow
