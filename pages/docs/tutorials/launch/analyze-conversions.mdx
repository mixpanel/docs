# Analyze Conversions
Use our [funnels](/docs/reports/funnels) report to analyze where your users convert, how long they take to do so, and what drives conversions.

To follow along the tutorials in this section, we've created [this board](https://mixpanel.com/s/43MU7y) in our demo project that you can copy into your own project. As you open the linked board, you will see instructions to click on "Use this board" to transfer it over to your project and to edit the default date range.

## Configuring Conversion Criteria
[Conversion Critera](/docs/reports/funnels#conversion-criteria) allows you to define how much time a user has to convert through all steps of the funnel after entering it and also determine how many times Mixpanel should count a particular user's activity towards your conversion rates.

## Advanced Funnel Features
Go beyond looking at overall conversion, view conversion trend over time, distribution of the time it takes users to convert through the funnel or the number of times users complete any step before converting or dropping off. Add more specificity to your conversion criteria by holding a [property constant](/docs/reports/funnels#hold-property-constant) over steps or [exlcude users who did a particular step](/docs/reports/funnels#exclusion-steps-exclude-users-who-did).

## Viewing as a Flow

You can see what flows or behaviors can increase the likelihood of conversion or drop-off by [viewing the funnel as a Flow](/docs/reports/funnels#view-as-flow).
