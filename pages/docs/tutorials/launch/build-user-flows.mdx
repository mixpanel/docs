## Overview
[Flows](/docs/reports/flows) identifies the most frequent paths taken by users to or from any event. Use Flows to understand how your users sequentially perform events in your product, and analyze drop-offs or unsuccessful behavior.
A great starting point would be to create a copy of [this board](https://mixpanel.com/s/4pQq4u) from our demo project into the affected project. As you open the linked board, you will see instructions to click on "Use this board" to transfer it over to your project and to edit the default date range.

## Top Paths
Another way to visualize your flows is by seeing the [Top Paths](/docs/reports/flows#top-paths). Condense the user flows down to unique paths on each row. This visualization is great for understanding the most common paths users take, though they may not be similar.
