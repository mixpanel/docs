# Build User Flows

[Flows](/docs/reports/flows) identifies the most frequent paths taken by users to or from any event. Use Flows to understand how your users sequentially perform events in your product, and analyze drop-offs or unsuccessful behavior.

## Top Paths
Another way to visualize your flows is by seeing the [Top Paths](/docs/reports/flows#top-paths). Condense the user flows down to unique paths on each row. This visualization is great for understanding the most common paths users take, though they may not be similar.
