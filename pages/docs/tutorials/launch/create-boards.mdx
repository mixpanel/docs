## Overview
A [Board](/docs/boards/overview) is a collection of reports, text, and images or videos, which allow you to view all your most important metrics at a glance. It can be used to keep your whole company on top of your KPIs. Add Insights, Flows, Funnels, and Retention reports to a board to be able to track those metrics both regularly and simultaneously.
A great starting point would be to create a copy of [this board](https://mixpanel.com/s/ZRRkD) from our demo project into the affected project. As you open the linked board, you will see instructions to click on "Use this board" to transfer it over to your project and to edit the default date range.

## How to use discover to find boards
[Discover](/changelogs/2023-04-14-discover) what your teammates measure or how they organize their Boards, and be inspired to create similar high-quality analyses. Filter searches by the teammate or object type (Board, Insights, Flows, etc.) and explore what top creators in the organization are measuring.

## How to create and share your own board
Start your analysis by creating a Board on Mixpanel. Add a new or existing report to it and enrich it with text and media cards. Once done, go ahead and [share](/docs/boards/advanced#sharing) this within your organisation for them to view or add creators to it and start collaborating

## How to use templates and recommended boards
It's now simple for anyone to get answers to important questions as soon as data is available in Mixpanel. [Templates](/docs/boards/templates) are out-of-the-box and fully customizable Boards designed to guide you section by section. They help you better understand your user base and monitor metrics like adoption, retention, virality, and product impact.

## Creating Digests
[Board Digests](/docs/boards/advanced#board-digests) are a snapshot of a board sent as an email or a slack message. Digests allow members to share recent data with both project members and external audiences, providing quick and meaningful insight into a Mixpanel project.
