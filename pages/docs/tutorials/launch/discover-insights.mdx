## Overview
Insights is a powerful and flexible reporting tool designed to visualize trends and compositions within your data. You can analyze events, cohorts and user profiles, and display the data in a wide variety of chart types.

## Data Functions, Filters and Breakdowns in Insights
Data Functions in Mixpanel reports allow you to perform more complex calculations on your queries - this includes computing aggregate values of your event and property data, including totals, uniques, and averages.

Filters in Insights serve as precision tools, enabling users to focus on specific data subsets aligned with their use cases. By applying filters in metrics or at report level, one can refine their data based on chosen parameters, refining the scope of their analysis.

Breakdowns amplify data granularity, allowing users to dissect information based on specific attributes. Breakdowns enhance the depth of analysis, providing a comprehensive understanding of user behavior and facilitating targeted strategies for optimizing product performance and user engagement.

## Formula, Custom Events and Properties and Custom Buckets
Use Formulas to make calculations using simple arithmetic operators. You can apply mathematical operations and transformations to shape data according to their unique requirements. This feature empowers users to derive tailored insights, calculate specific KPIs, and uncover hidden patterns within the analytics.
You can also save and share the formulas allowing you and others to reuse it once you start a new analysis - no need to rebuild it from scratch and trust them as standardized metrics within your organisation.


## Behavioural Breakdowns
Behavioral Breakdowns â€” a new way to segment users by what they do, not just who they are. Now, you have the ability to measure the correlation between a user's actions and their level of engagement, monetization, or other essential metrics.
