## Overview
[Insights](/docs/reports/insights) is a powerful and flexible reporting tool designed to visualize trends and compositions within your data. You can analyze events, cohorts and user profiles, and display the data in a wide variety of chart types.
A great starting point would be to create a copy of [this board](https://mixpanel.com/s/31c4uP) from our demo project into the affected project. As you open the linked board, you will see instructions to click on "Use this board" to transfer it over to your project and to edit the default date range.

## Data Functions, Filters and Breakdowns in Insights
[Data Functions](/docs/reports/insights#insights-data-functions-operators-and-calculations) in Mixpanel reports allow you to perform more complex calculations on your queries - this includes computing aggregate values of your event and property data, including totals, uniques, and averages.

Filters in Insights serve as precision tools, enabling users to focus on specific data subsets aligned with their use cases. By applying filters in metrics or at report level, one can refine their data based on chosen parameters, refining the scope of their analysis.

Breakdowns amplify data granularity, allowing users to dissect information based on specific attributes. Breakdowns enhance the depth of analysis, providing a comprehensive understanding of user behavior and facilitating targeted strategies for optimizing product performance and user engagement.

## Formula, Custom Events and Properties and Custom Buckets
Use [Formulas](/docs/reports/insights#formulas) to make calculations using simple arithmetic operators. You can apply mathematical operations and transformations to shape data according to their unique requirements. This feature empowers users to derive tailored insights, calculate specific KPIs, and uncover hidden patterns within the analytics. You can also save and share the formulas allowing you and others to reuse it once you start a new analysis - no need to rebuild it from scratch and trust them as standardized metrics within your organisation.
You can create [Custom Events](/docs/features/custom-events) from one or more events, optionally filtered down by a particular set of properties. or create [Custom Properties](/docs/features/custom-properties) by combining existing properties into new properties on the fly, using a simple Excel-like formula language.

## Behavioural Breakdowns
[Behavioral Breakdowns](/docs/features/advanced#behavioral-properties) â€” a new way to segment users by what they do, not just who they are. Now, you have the ability to measure the correlation between a user's actions and their level of engagement, monetization, or other essential metrics.

## Saving your report and setting up Alerts
Create [Alerts](/docs/features/alerts) for your saved Insights and Funnels reports, allowing you to monitor custom report conditions, or automatically detect anomalies and receive email notifications or slack alerts when those conditions are met.
