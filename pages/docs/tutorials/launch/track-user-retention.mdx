## Overview
[Retention](/docs/reports/retention) report in Mixpanel is designed to assess user engagement over a specified period of time. Retention of your users is critical to achieving product-market fit and sustainable long-term growth, and this report will help you understand how long users continue to come back and find value from your product.

## Understanding Retention Criteria
Define retention analysis to calcuate users who come back on a specific time unit (e.g. day, week, month) or any time unit afterwards. You can also switch the retention mode between the default rolling time window and calendar defined time window.

## Understanding Frequency Criteria
Define retention analysis to calcuate users who did the event in at least X unique intervals or in exactly X unique intervals.
