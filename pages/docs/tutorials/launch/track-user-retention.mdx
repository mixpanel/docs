# Track User Retention

Our [Retention](/docs/reports/retention) report in Mixpanel is designed to help you assess user engagement over a specified period of time. Have you achieved product market fit? Are your users returning over time or churning? Which cohort of users come back and what drives them to?

## Understanding Retention Criteria
Define retention analysis to calcuate users who come back on a specific time unit (e.g. day, week, month) or any time unit afterwards. You can also switch the retention mode between the default rolling time window and calendar defined time window.
