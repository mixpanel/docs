## Overview
[Retention](/docs/reports/retention) report in Mixpanel is designed to assess user engagement over a specified period of time. Retention of your users is critical to achieving product-market fit and sustainable long-term growth, and this report will help you understand how long users continue to come back and find value from your product.
A great starting point would be to create a copy of [this board](https://mixpanel.com/s/2j6MCl) from our demo project into the affected project. As you open the linked board, you will see instructions to click on "Use this board" to transfer it over to your project and to edit the default date range.

## Understanding Retention Criteria
Define retention analysis to calcuate users who come back on a specific time unit (e.g. day, week, month) or any time unit afterwards. You can also switch the retention mode between the default rolling time window and calendar defined time window.

## Understanding Frequency Criteria
Define retention analysis to calcuate users who did the event in at least X unique intervals or in exactly X unique intervals.
