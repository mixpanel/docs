# Overview
Before you even start sending data into your Mixpanel projects, it's important to take some time plan out how to organize your Mixpanel projects, what to measure, and how to put together a tracking strategy.

## Setup
For Organization Owners and Admins, the [Setup](docs/tutorials/plan/setup) takes you through how you should go about setting up your Mixpanel Organization and the underlying projects. 

## Framework
If you have not defined your metrics and KPIs (*what you should measure*) that align to your company or product objectives, and need guidance, the [Framework](docs/tutorials/plan/framework) tutorial should help you. 

## Tracking Strategy
You can start to develop your tracking strategy once you've identified the key metrics you want to track. The [Tracking Strategy](docs/tutorials/plan/tracking-strategy) tutorial will guide you on our Mixpanel data model, so you're equipped with how to build out your tracking plan.
