# Analytics Framework

These days, businesses have mountains of data generated from people using their products on all kinds of devices. From apps to websites and smart devices, there is no shortage of data, and companies are sitting on a gold mine of product data. 

Despite the abundance of data available to product teams, in a [survey](https://mixpanel.com/blog/the-state-of-product-analytics-in-2020-and-how-to-move-forward) (conducted by Mixpanel in collaboration with Product School) of 450 product leaders across the globe, only 10% reported being able to validate all of their important product decisions with data. In addition, over 50% of product teams feel they are unable to quickly get answers to product questions.

## Importance of Analytics Strategy

Product managers are riddled with buzzwords, metrics, and frameworks that overwhelm attempts to understand the users and make better products for them. However, strip away the jargons, and the problem that every product manager is trying to solve today becomes very clear; that is: to build products that customers find valuable. Thus, the foundation of any product analytics strategy is essentially, to ***measure a productâ€™s value against a userâ€™s desire to exchange something for it***.

Having a framework helps you structure your metrics and KPIs around the strategy, goals, and objectives of your business to drive value for your users. It also helps align various teams and stakeholders towards a shared vision for product development and execution around your product's value.

## The RAE Framework

Mixpanel's RAE Framework, which stands for (R)each, (A)ctivation, and (E)ngagement, is a simple framework allowing you to focus on 2-3 key metrics / KPIs to plan for the events and properties that you need to measure them. This framework also translates into a clearly defined funnel or sequence of events that monitors your product's reach, to enabling user activation, and finally tracking the level of your users' engagement.

As you go deeper in your analytics strategy, you can progress to using [Mixpanel's Focus Metric Framework](/docs/best-practices/analytics-strategy/overview#adopting-a-measurement-framework) which provides a more granular approach to tracking success metrics.

### Measure your Product's Value

Your product's metrics and KPIs should be defined around your product's value to your target users. The more value your users derive from your product, the higher their adoption and engagement which leads to higher retention.

</p>

In order to measure your product's value *(i.e. what is the problem that your solution is trying to solve)*, you need to:

1. Identify the **key actions** that indicate a user is getting value out of your product
2. Match these key actions to their expected **natural frequency** (daily / weekly / monthly) at solving your userâ€™s problem

These key actions + natural frequency is what we call **Value Moments**. The more value moments means more opportunities for users to build a habit *(i.e. product stickiness)* around your product and remain long term customer. Using value moments as metrics helps you set tangible goals and measure what really matters.

![image](/tutorials/value-moment.png "Value Moment")

For more details on Measuring Value read [Chapter 1 of The Guide to Product Analytics](https://mixpanel.com/content/guide-to-product-analytics/chapter_1) and how it impacts product [Growth](/docs/best-practices/analytics-strategy/growth).

### Retain your Productâ€™s Reach

**Reach** is defined as the total number of users who have used your product in a recent time period.

- For consumer companies, it could be the number of paid accounts, or users who have made purchases in the past three months. 
- For B2B companies, this key metric is often product install base or number of paid licenses within the past quarter or year.

</p>

Reach is important because it represents the maximum amount of users who could reasonably become [active](/docs/tutorials/plan/framework#activate-your-users) and [engaged](/docs/tutorials/plan/framework#increase-level-of-user-engagement), whether organically or through re-engagement campaigns. The goal is to focus on retaining your Reach, and in order to do that, you need to track:

- Rate of activating your New User - getting them to value as quickly as possible
- Percentage of Non-Activated to Activated Users - eliminating the barriers causing non-activation
- Percentage of Dormant to Active Users - resurrecting users who have gone dormant

![image](/tutorials/product-reach.png "Product Reach")

The goal is to ensure that a majority of your Reach are active users who are continuously finding value from your product. 

### Activate your Users

User Activation is not about a user creating their account or signing-up on your product. It is the process of taking a user from sign-up to establishing a habit around your productâ€™s core value proposition. The userâ€™s first impression of your product influences every step that follows, including further engagement and upgrades.

_Loom Video to be inserted below once ready_
<p style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0, overflow: 'hidden' }}>
  <iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/_Loom ID_" frameborder="0" style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }} allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

Activation can be viewed as a 3 step funnel where users go through setting up, to understanding the value of your product, and then experiencing more of that value to want to continue using it.

<u>Setup</u>
- Leading indicator for user experiencing value for the 1st time
- Absolute must have action / information that leads to user finding value
- Defined as the number of times the user has done the setup action within the initial time period from sign-up

<u>Aha!</u>
- Helps predict if a user will start to develop habitual behaviour
- Indicates the 1st time your user is discovering the value of your product
- Defined as the first number of times the user has done the core value action within the initial time period
 
<u>Habit</u>
- Tells us a user is likely to become an engaged user
- Enables habit formation where a user repeatedly experience the core value of your product
- Defined as the number of times the user has done the core value action for every time period within the initial window ***(for habit formation)***

![image](/tutorials/activation-metric.png "Activation Metric")

ðŸ’¡ Products with really long activation periods will need to be broken down further into even smaller pieces. For example, signing up for a home loan has an extremely long activation period and funnel.

### Increase User Engagement

Engagement measures the depth of user activity in discovering or experiencing more value moments from your product. Highly engaged users are more likely to contribute to stronger product growth, as they not only contribute to more "value exchange", but are also more likely to recommend your product. 

![image](/tutorials/engagement-cohorts.png "Activation Metric")

To measure the level of engagement, an example is to segment your users into Casual, Core, and Power users against your engagement strategy.

_Loom Video to be inserted below once ready_

</p>

Reforge classifies engagement into four general strategies which can be combined depending on your product:

- **Adding use cases** - moving users to adopt additional product use cases *(Example: Uber rides to Uber Eats)*
- **Increasing feature usage** - increasing the percentage of product feature usage *(Example: search filters, recommendations, match alerts)*
- **Increasing usage frequency** - increasing the frequency of product usage *(Example: from 1 value action to 3 value actions in 7 days)*
- **Increasing intensity** - increasing the intensity (spend, time, actions) of each product usage *(Example: spending more time playing a game or more money during cart checkouts)*

The end goal of segmenting your users into different engagement cohorts is to move users from a less engaged to a more engaged state *(ie Casual -> Core)*.

For more details on defining and viewing your users cohorts, read [Engagement](/docs/best-practices/analytics-strategy/engagement) in Mixpanel docs.

## Crafting your Metrics and KPIs

Regardless of the Analytics Framework you adopt, it's important to craft your metrics and KPIs based on your business' goals, ensuring they are not only result-oriented, but also actionable. Leverage on the following key pointers as you define your metrics and KPIs:

- **Meaningful**: aligns with your organisation's vision, mission and strategy, based on your product's value moments, easy to understand
- **Measurable**: can be quantified, tracked, calculated, and assessed
- **Manageable**: within your product's influence or control, realistic, pragmatic
- **Movable**: can be improved through targetted initiatives, action-oriented
- **Timebound**: trackable within a defined limited period of time, not open-ended

![image](/tutorials/metrics-to-avoid.png "Metrics to Avoid")

Having the right metrics enables you to develop the key insights necessary to make better decisions for your product. Here's are some metrics that you might want to avoid and tips on how you can transform them into more impactful metrics instead.

- **Vanity Metrics**: doesn't help you understand your product performance that informs future strategies; instead, focus on **Value Metrics** that measure how your target users perceive value to effect "value exhchange" (see [How Viber shifted from vanity to value metrics](https://mixpanel.com/blog/metrics-that-matter-to-viber-a-formula-to-meaningfully-measure-active-users/))
- **Lagging Metrics**: after-the-fact measured outcomes that are no longer actionable (example: revenue, churn); instead, focus on **Leading Metrics** that help you anticipate and predict what will happen so you can be more tactical in course-correcting (more details on looking at [Leading and Lagging Indicators to Measure Product Progress](https://herbig.co/leading-lagging-indicators-okrs/))

## Summary

As your product evolves so should your metrics and KPIs. Depending on your key value moment's natural frequency, business objectives, and product maturity, you should be reviewing your metrics periodically (eg: every 3, 6, or 12 months) to see if they are still relevant in driving product and busines growth.

To sum up everything you've learned, here's an example of the RAE Framework. You can also access a copy of a [blank RAE Framework Template from here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sYBm9RA_pSoQLCLjsbcfyG-8Gd08CpWbEghd82ERtcc/edit?usp=sharing). Save a copy to your device to get started on defining your metrics and KPIs.
