# Setting Up Your Mixpanel

> Note: this section is for Organization Owners and Organization Admins who are responsible for setting up your Organisation and Projects.

You should have a Mixpanel [Organization](/docs/orgs-and-projects/organizations) already assigned to your login if you had signed up as the main Mixpanel [Owner](/docs/orgs-and-projects/roles-and-permissions#owner). In case you don't, please contact our [Mixpanel Support](/docs/response-times#contacting-mixpanel-support) team for assistance.

To quickly get you setup, here's an outline of what we'll be covering in this section:

1. Configuring your Mixpanel **Organization's Discoverability** *(Enterprise Plan non-SSO accounts only)*
2. Creating separate **Development and Production Mixpanel Projects**
4. Planning your users' **Data Access and Visibility** using Mixpanel's [Data Views & Classfication](/docs/data-governance/data-views-and-classification) *(Enterprise Plan Only)*
5. Seting up **Teams** or **Add Users** to Mixpanel Projects

## Organization Discoverability
By default, an organization is setup as __Invite Only__, which means new users must be explicitly invited by an admin to be part of the organization. If you are on an [Enterprise Plan](https://mixpanel.com/settings/org/plan) and do not plan to setup [SSO](/docs/access-security/single-sign-on/overview), Mixpanel recommends setting one of the following organisation discoverability, by specifying the email domain(s) that should be granted access when a new user signs up for Mixpanel:

1. **Open Organization** - any new user with maching email domain(s) can join
2. **Admin Approval** - admins will receieve email notification (and approve) for users who made a request to join

Click [here](https://mixpanel.com/settings/org/users-and-teams/find-your-org) to setup, or for more information refer to docs on [Organization Discoverability](/docs/orgs-and-projects/organizations#organization-discoverability)

## Development and Production Project Setup
We recommend that you minimally setup 2 Mixpanel projects, one for Development data and another for Production data. This is to ensure that you keep development test data separate from actual live user behavioural data. Read more details about [Developer Environments](/docs/best-practices/developer-environments).

![image](/tutorials/create-projects.png "Create Projects")

1. Go to the **Projects** under your **Organization Settings**, click [here](https://mixpanel.com/settings/org/projects)
2. Click **Create Project** to create each project
   - We recommend choosing **United States** as *Where To Store Your Data* (unless you have [EU Residency](/docs/privacy/eu-residency) requirements)
   - Select the **Timezone** with which you want to analyze your data (more information on [Project Timezones](/docs/orgs-and-projects/managing-projects#manage-timezones-for-projects))

Refer to docs on [Project Setup](docs/best-practices/project-setup) for more detailed steps and best practices.

## Plan Data Access and Visibility

By default, all data in a Mixpanel project is accessible to all your users in the Mixpanel organization. However, you might have requrements to segregate data visibility or restrict access to certain data that might be considered more sensitive and should not viewable by the entire organization.

> Note: Data Views and Classfied Data settings are at project level. You would need to have data in your Mixpanel project to be able to configure these settings.

### Data Views
Data Views allow Project Owners and Admins to manage data access for a group of users within a single Mixpanel project for privacy and productivity purposes. 

![image](/tutorials/data-views-filter.png "Data Views Filter")

A combination of filters can be applied depending upon the data access required:
1. Events - include or exclude specific events names
2. Event Properties - filter explicit property values across events *(example: Mixpanel Library = web)*
3. User Profile Properties - filter explicit users based on their user property value *(example: Staff User = true)*
> Note: Filtering by User Profile Properties removes the ability to analyze by [Groups](/docs/data-structure/advanced/group-analytics#group-by-a-custom-identifier)

</p>

The key to managing data access is to ensure that you plan your tracking data around the data access controls that your project requires. Example, to be able to segregate data access by different countries, you would need to track a global `country` event property in all your events.

Refer to docs for a detailed guide on setting up [Data Views](/docs/data-governance/data-views-and-classification#data-views-overview).

### Classified Data
In general, you should **_not be sending_** data that are considered sensitive (ie: Personal Identifiable Information, Secured Data, etc.) to your Mixpanel projects. Do consult your company's legal, security, or compliance teams before you send any potential sensitive data. Also refer to Mixpanel's [Legal Hub](https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy) for our Privacy Program.

In scenarios where you are allowed to send data that may be partially sensitive and accessible only to certain privilege users in your company, you can mark event and user properties as [Classified Data](/docs/data-governance/data-views-and-classification#mark-properties-as-classified-data) allowing you to grant view access to only specific users.

</p>

Once data is in your project, ensure that you have marked all relevant event and user properties as classified before you start granting access to users.

Refer to docs for a detailed guide on setting up [Classified Data](/docs/data-governance/data-views-and-classification#data-classification).

## Setup Teams or Add Users to Mixpanel Projects

There are two general approaches to user management in Mixpanel. 

- [Teams](/docs/orgs-and-projects/roles-and-permissions#teams) - organization owners and admins create teams at the organization level, grant projects and permissions, and assign users to teams.
- [Project based](/docs/orgs-and-projects/roles-and-permissions#invite-users-to-a-project) - organization admins appoint project level admins who grant permissions to users.

![image](/tutorials/user-access-approach.png "User Access Approach")

Users are required to be part of your Mixpanel Organization (either through [self-joining](/docs/orgs-and-projects/organizations#organization-discoverability) or via an [invitation from the admin](/docs/orgs-and-projects/roles-and-permissions#invite-users-to-an-organization)), before they can be granted access to any Mixpanel Project.

1. Go to the **Users & Teams** under **Organization Settings** to setup your **Teams**, click [here](https://mixpanel.com/settings/org/users-and-teams/teams) _(Optional)_
2. Invite users to your [organization](/docs/orgs-and-projects/roles-and-permissions#invite-users-to-an-organization), either add them to teams or directly add them into your [projects](/docs/orgs-and-projects/roles-and-permissions#invite-users-to-a-project)
3. Assign the appropriate [Organization](/docs/orgs-and-projects/roles-and-permissions#organization-roles) and [Project](/docs/orgs-and-projects/roles-and-permissions#project-roles) roles; a default project role can also be set for All Users in the Organization as a baseline access. 

Refer to docs for a detailed guide on [Project Setup](/docs/best-practices/project-setup).
