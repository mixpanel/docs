## Overviews

As an Organization Admin, you may create and manage security processes that dictate the requirements needed for your users to access your organization. 

Here are some suggested steps to take for you to get started:
1. Configure Your Organization Discoverability settings 
2. Create Your Mixpanel Projects 
3. Set up Data Views or Classified Data 
4. Invite Users or Teams to Your Projects

## Organization Discoverability
Organization Discoverability makes it seamless for new users with a shared work email domain to connect with teammates in an existing organization in Mixpanel, allowing them to access their team’s projects, data, and reports, instead of joining a new, empty org.

This feature is accessible to new users who have verified their email as well as existing organizations that are not on Enterprise plan and do not have SSO enabled.

### Setting Discoverability

Only **organization owners** and **billing admins** can access [Organization Discoverability](/docs/orgs-and-projects/organizations#organization-discoverability) by going to Organization Settings > Users & Teams > Organization Discoverability.

They can enable Organization Discoverability by first specifying the private (i.e. work) email domain(s) that should be granted access when a new user signs up for Mixpanel. Please note that public email domains, such as Gmail or Yahoo, cannot be used.

The org owner or admin can then designate the level of discoverability of their organization; **open to join**, **subject to admin approval**, or **invite only**.


## Project Setup

### Creating Your Mixpanel Projects
Within your Mixpanel organization, we recommend at the minimum having [separate development and production projects](/docs/best-practices/developer-environments). Keeping your development data separate is important to maintain the integrity of your Mixpanel data. It's easy to prevent development data from cluttering your production project, but hard to detangle in later stages of a project.

In certain instances, it may make sense to [create separate production projects](/docs/best-practices/developer-environments) as well. For example, if your app or web offers fundamentally different functionality and the user journey is drastically varied, it may make sense to use separate projects so as not to clutter your analytics. 

In general though, if you want to track and study cross-platform user behaviour, we recommend using a single production project. Example scenarios:

- Your platform teams - web, android, iOS - are separate and just need access to their own data. You can use event properties, e.g. platform = ‘web’, to create [data views](/docs/data-governance/data-views-and-classification) and give relevant teams access to the views they need. The bonus in this scenario is that you for boards / reports is automatically shared with the different platform teams, and automatically filtered to their specific platform.
- You have a B2B and a B2C platform and want to be able to analyze certain users’ behaviour across both platforms. For instance, you’re a restaurant with a B2B app to manage multiple restaurants and reservations. You also have a B2C app for customers to make reservations. You want to analyze metrics across different entities: customers, restaurants, and reservations of which certain actions can be done either on the B2B or B2C platform. Being able to analyze conversions across these entities where actions can be done on either platform requires data to be in 1 project and having [Group Analytics](/docs/data-structure/advanced/group-analytics) as an add-on.
- You have sensitive data that you do want to send into Mixpanel, but want to prevent some users from getting access. In this case, you can still use a single project, but leverage [classified data](/docs/data-governance/data-views-and-classification#mark-properties-as-classified-data) to mark those event or user properties as classified so that only users with access can query and see results on them.
- You want to share your Mixpanel metrics perhaps with users outside your organization, who only access to consume reports but not need query underlying data - e.g. exec stakeholders who want to see summary metrics, or external vendors that need specific reports. For this, you could turn on and provide [public boards](/docs/boards/public-boards).

### Data Views and Data Classification

Data Views allow you to manage or filter data access for a group of users within a single Mixpanel project for privacy and productivity purposes. Data View Filters can be applied to multiple events, event properties, and user profile properties. A detailed guide on how to go about setting up Data Views can be found [here](/docs/data-governance/data-views-and-classification#create-data-view).
**Do note that applying any user profile property as a filter will remove the ability to analyze by [Group Identifiers](/docs/data-structure/advanced/group-analytics#group-by-a-custom-identifier)

On the other hand, classified data would be more suitable in scenarios where sensitive data are being sent to Mixpanel and should only be accessible to certain users. Data Classification allows you to mark event or user properties as classified and grant view access to only specific users or teams. A detailed guide on how to go about setting up classified data can be found[here](/docs/data-governance/data-views-and-classification#create-data-view).

### Adding End Users to Your Mixpanel Organization and Projects
Organisation Owners and Admins would need to [invite end users to the organization](/docs/orgs-and-projects/roles-and-permissions#invite-users), before they can add end users to a project.


There are two general approaches to user management in Mixpanel. 

- Organization owners and admins can create [teams](/docs/orgs-and-projects/manage-team-members#teams) at the organization level and then add teams to the different projects. Typically, larger enterprise customers prefer to use this, along with [Single Sign-On](/docs/access-security/single-sign-on/overview), for better management of users.

### Creating Mixpanel Teams at the Organizational Level

### Adding Teams and / or End Users to Projects
Organization owners and admins can assign projects or teams directly to user accounts at the organization level by minimally provisioning them with an organization membership.

### Invite Users to Specific Projects

Once [project owners and admins](/docs/orgs-and-projects/roles-and-permissions#setting-a-default-role-on-a-project) are assigned, they can then add end users to projects and provision their roles.  A default project role can also be set for All Users in the Organization as a baseline access.

## Roles and Permissions
For a better understanding of the 4 roles in an organisation: Owner, Admin, Billing Admin & member and its respective permissions, you could refer to a detailed documentation on [Organisation Roles](/docs/orgs-and-projects/roles-and-permissions#organization-roles). Similarly, every project in an organisation has 4 roles: Owner, Admin, Analyst, Consumer and the respective permissions per role is further explained in [Project Roles](/docs/orgs-and-projects/roles-and-permissions#project-roles).
