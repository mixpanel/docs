 # Build Your Tracking Strategy

## Data Model

### The Building Blocks: Events and Event Properties
Events are the foundation of the Mixpanel Data Model. In order to conduct analysis and gather meaningful insights from Mixpanel reports, you will need to understand and design events and event properties based on your business requirements and specific use  cases.

To summarize: 
* In Mixpanel, all events have a name, a timestamp, and a user ID. 
* Events represent an interaction between the user and your product. 
* Event properties provide description or add context to the event. 

Below is an example of the structure of Mixpanel event along with event properties. The event name should intuitively describe the user action or behavior that triggers this event.

### User Profile
User Profiles let you enrich events with properties about the users that performed those events.

## Creating a Tracking Plan

### Overview 
Going through this guide should help you understand the necessary concepts and steps to build out your tracking plan as it aligns to your business goals from your Analytics Strategy Framework. 

Your completed tracking plan will help you to: 
- Define your business goals / KPIs and analytics strategy metrics. 
- Outline the events, event properties, and user profile properties aligned to your metrics. 
- Be treated as a living and shared document that is continuously updated with any implementation changes
- Include notes that are referenced across stakeholders

### Tracking Plan Methodology (share examples of use cases) 
Prioritize and be intentional with your data based on your business goals and key use cases. You can create a comprehensive tracking plan, but make sure to identify the key objectives, the KPIs, and the events and properties for your onboarding. Having a clear alignment on priorities will allow you to move quickly in a phased approach to your implementation.

A successful onboarding typically focuses on one or two key use cases. Some examples can be:
- the registration or sign up process
- a required activation or account set up journey
- the purchase funnel
- an important engagement journey (watching content, creating a playlist, planning a route, importing files to your platform, setting up an integration)

### Map KPIs to User Flows
Map each of your metrics to the steps or specific actions that users take to influence each metric. For example, sign up flow will be important when measuring KPIs related to new user acquisition. Consider all the different user paths users can take and what specific measures will allow you to track, measure, and improve the expected desired user outcomes across activation, engagement, and/or retention. 

### Identity Management 
As you go through building out your tracking plan, be sure to consider where you will need to manage user identity.

In short summary, when a user goes from being anonymous to when that user completes registration or and logs in, you will want to properly identify this user with a distinct ID.  For a full understanding of this critical concept, please review our [Identity Management guide here](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-methods/identifying-users)

### Translate Flows into Event/Properties
Breakdown your user flows into events (actions) and properties (context of these actions) in your tracking plan. This will ensure that you have scoped out the data you need to achieve your KPIs / metrics in Mixpanel.

### Define Naming Convention
Defining a naming convention will help maintain data quality and trust over time. Having an intuitive and easy to understand naming convention helps end users more easily make sense of the data. Also, remember that Mixpanel is case sensitive (e.g., sign up completed vs. Sign Up Completed will show up as two separate events).

It can be helpful to document the naming convention guidelines so everyone can be aware and adhere to these.

Here are a few simple guidelines to help you think through how to structure your naming convention:

- **Consistent**: make sure the name is standard across your different event names and properties as well as across your platforms.
- **Concise**: keep things short and simple but informative.
- **Clean**: the data should be easily understood that is case-sensitive.

You may want to avoid abbreviations or specific jargon that may not be immediately or easily understandable.

### Event Name Depth 
When designing your data schema, you will also want to determine the proper level of event depth. As you determine what user actions to track, you'll want to strike the right balance to make sure events are not too specific or too broad.
