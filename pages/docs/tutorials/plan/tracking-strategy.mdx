 # Build Your Tracking Strategy

## Data Model

### The Building Blocks: Events and Event Properties
Events are the foundation of the Mixpanel Data Model. In order to conduct analysis and gather meaningful insights from Mixpanel reports, you will need to understand and design events and event properties based on your business requirements and specific use  cases.

To summarize: 
* In Mixpanel, all events have a name, a timestamp, and a user ID. 
* Events represent an interaction between the user and your product. 
* Event properties provide description or add context to the event. 

Below is an example of the structure of Mixpanel event along with event properties. The event name should intuitively describe the user action or behavior that triggers this event.

Along with the Data Model Overview video, this [Mixpanel Data Model Board](https://mixpanel.com/project/2195193/view/139237/app/boards/#id=4600772/) in a sample Mixpanel project offeres an in-depth explanation and to see how events and event properties can look within the platform.

## Creating a Tracking Plan

### Overview 
Going through this guide should help you understand the necessary concepts and steps to build out your tracking plan as it aligns to your business goals from your Analytics Strategy Framework. 

Your completed tracking plan will help you to: 
- Serve as a centralized document that should serve as the source of truth for your Mixpanel implementation
- Define your business goals / KPIs and analytics strategy metrics. 
- Outline the events, event properties, and user profile properties aligned to your metrics. 
- Be treated as a living and shared document that is continuously updated with any implementation changes
- Include notes that are referenced across teams (product, marketing, data science, tech / dev teams, etc.)
