# Build Your Tracking Strategy

## Data Model

### Events and Event Properties
Events and Event Properties are the foundation of the Mixpanel Data Model and will be the building blocks used in Mixpanel reports for your analysis. 
Events represent an interaction between the user and your product. 
Event properties provide description or add context to the event. 
In Mixpanel, all events have a name, a timestamp, and a user ID. 

For a more complete overview, please take a look at the [Events and Properties](/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties) help doc.

Below is an example of what a Mixpanel event might look like. The event name should intuitively describe the user action or behavior that triggers this event.

Along with the video overview, you can also take a look at this [Mixpanel Data Model Board] (/https://mixpanel.com/project/2195193/view/139237/app/boards/#id=4600772) in a sample Mixpanel project for an in-depth explanation and to see how events and event properties can look within the platform.
