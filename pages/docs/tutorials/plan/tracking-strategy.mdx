# Build Your Tracking Strategy

It's important to first understand Mixpanel's Data Model and then create a Tracking Plan using this model to define the actions or behaviours that you want to track in order to measure your metrics and KPIs. This ensures that your data is structured to maximise Mixpanel's analytics capabilities. If you have not thought about your metrics and KPIs, now is a good time to read up on [Analytics Framework](/docs/tutorials/plan/framework).

## The Mixpanel Data Model

### Behaviours: Events and Event Properties

Events are the foundation of Mixpanel's Data Model. In order to conduct meaningful analysis and gather insights using Mixpanel reports, you should understand and intentionally design your events and event properties based on your business objectives, specific use cases, and key metrics.

Events represent interactions between the user and your product and are fundamentally immutable *(eg for historical snapshot)*:

* All events should have an **Event Name**, a **Timestamp** of when that event has occured, and a **Distinct ID** to tie all events belonging to the same user
* Events have event properties that provide additional context or details about the event

It's important to only track events that align to the metrics you want to measure, and always include relevant event properties that will enable you to drill deeper into the analysis.

For more details and examples refer to our documentation on [Events and Properties](/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties).

### Demographics: User Profile and User Properties

While events capture behaviours or user actions, user profiles capture demographical attributes which help in cohorting users based on their latest characteristics such as users' details *(e-mail, phone)*, device information *(brand, model)*, users' geographical locations *(country, region, city)*, product related details *(current subscriptions, customer type)*  etc. 

User profiles are in a separate object from events and are mutable *(eg for current snapshot)*:

* All user profiles should have a **Distinct ID** that can be used to tie to events belonging to the same user
* User profiles have user properties that capture these demographical attributes
* A user that has events, can exist in Mixpanel without having a user profile, especially when they are anonymous *(eg not logged in)*

As a best practice, think of event properties that you track under events which might also be useful as user properties. This would allow you to analyse a user property which provides the latest state or value against the same event property that records a value in the past. Example use case: I want to analyze users who are currently in country = "Singapore" *(user property)* did these users also used my product in another country *(event property)*.

For more details and examples refer to our documentation on [User Profiles](/docs/data-structure/user-profiles).

Along with the Data Model Overview video above, you can refer to this [Mixpanel Data Model Board](https://mixpanel.com/project/2195193/view/139237/app/boards/#id=4600772/) in our Mixpanel demo project which offers both an in-depth explanation as well as a glimpse into events and event properties live-in-action within the platform. 

### Understanding Special Properties 

**Super Properties**: In some cases, you may have certain relevant properties in which you may want to include with every event you send.  Unlike regular event properties, which are tied to individual events, super properties remain constant across multiple events, providing overarching context or information about the user or their environment.

These attributes are typically more about the user such as age, gender, source, or perhaps subscription plan type. Mixpanel allows you to register these properties as super properties so you can just let us know once, and these properties will be included in all subsequent events. 

Check out the link to find more information on 
[Super Properties](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript#super-properties).

**Reserved Properties**: Mixpanel have some properties that are reserved for special use or processing within our UI. 

Check out the link to find more information on [Reserved Properties](/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties#reserved-event-properties).

**Default Properties**: If you are specifically using the Mixpanel client-side SDKs, we will automatically collect certain properties on every event where possible. 

Check out the link to find more information on [Default Properties](/docs/data-structure/property-reference).

### Group Analytics
At the fundamental level, Mixpanel allows behavioral data analysis at the individual user level. Group Analytics is an add-on feature that allows you to conduct analysis at a customized group level such as company, account, device, or any other group entity that makes sense for your business use case. 

Similar to how each individual user event must have a distinct ID sent as an event property, **every relevant group event should also have a distinct group ID, such as Company ID or an Account ID sent along as a event property with each event**. Mixpanel will then thread all group level behaviors to enable you to conduct analysis at the group level. 

Additionally, just like each user can have a User Profile, each group can also have a Group Profile that capture and store meaningful group attributes to better understand the group level attributes. For example, a Company Profile may include group properties such as industry, company size, annual spend, or number of seats.

Keep in mind that not every business necessarily has use cases that may require Group Analytics.

## Creating a Tracking Plan

Now that we have an understanding of the Mixpanel Data Model, going through this following guide should help you understand the necessary concepts and steps to build out your own tracking plan as it aligns to your business goals defined from your [Analytics Strategy Framework](/docs/tutorials/plan/framework). 

<p style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0, overflow: 'hidden' }}>
  <iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/78bca8ab574f4803a2d68b7c5bfa1bce?sid=373c2f06-a223-4078-a85d-e56fef538741" frameborder="0" style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }} allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

We encourage you to keep this tracking plan as a living and shared document that is continuously updated with any implementation changes.

### Tracking Plan Methodology
Prioritize and be intentional with your data based on your business goals and key use cases. You can create a comprehensive tracking plan, but make sure to identify the key objectives, the KPIs, and the events and properties for your onboarding. 

Having a clear alignment on priorities will allow you to move quickly in a phased approach to your implementation.

#### Map KPIs to User Flows
Map each of your metrics to the steps or specific actions that users take to influence each metric. For example, sign up flow will be important when measuring KPIs related to new user acquisition. Consider all the different user paths users can take and what specific measures will allow you to track, measure, and improve the expected desired user outcomes across activation, engagement, and/or retention. 

Having specific questions that you want to answer will help you think through which specific events are relevant and important to include. 

> Note on Identity Management: As you go through building out your tracking plan, it's also important to consider where you will need to measure user identity. For instance, when a user goes from being anonymous to when that user completes registration or and logs in, you will want to properly identify this user with a distinct ID.  For a full understanding of this critical concept, please review our [Identity Management guide here](/docs/tracking-methods/identifying-users)

#### Translate Flows into Event/Properties
If you use a tool like FigJam, Miro, or similar design products to track your user journey, you can use it to help capture the events and properties you want to track as well. It's a lot easier to understand the specific screens or page views, the exact steps in your user journey, and the actions that trigger your user behaviour, if you can see what the flow looks like. 

Here is an example of aÂ [User Journey in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/tYEeeRE0Xz6IampBhGLotw/Media-and-Entertainment-Tracking-Plan?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=ShUKEHAG2PlL9wNa-1)**.**

#### Define Naming Convention
Defining a naming convention will help maintain data quality and trust over time. Having an intuitive and easy to understand naming convention helps end users more easily make sense of the data. Also, remember that Mixpanel is case sensitive (e.g., sign up completed vs. Sign Up Completed will show up as two separate events).

It can be helpful to document the naming convention guidelines so everyone can be aware and adhere to these.

Here are a few simple guidelines to help you think through how to structure your naming convention:

- **Consistent**: make sure the name is standard across your different event names and properties as well as across your platforms.
- **Concise**: keep things short and simple but informative.
- **Clean**: the data should be easily understood.

You may want to avoid abbreviations or specific jargon that may not be immediately or easily understandable.

You can find more information on events and properties naming conventionÂ [best practices](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties#best-practices).

#### Event Name Depth 
When designing your data schema, you will also want to determine the proper level of event depth. As you determine what user actions to track, you'll want to strike the right balance to make sure events are not too specific or too broad.
