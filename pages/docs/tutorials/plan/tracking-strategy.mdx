# Build Your Tracking Strategy

## Data Model

### Events and Event Properties
Events and Event Properties are the foundation of the Mixpanel Data Model and will be the building blocks used in Mixpanel reports for your analysis. 

Events represent an interaction between the user and your product. 
Event properties provide description or add context to the event. 
In Mixpanel, all events have a name, a timestamp, and a user ID. 

For a more complete overview, please take a look at [Events and Properties](/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties).

Below is an example of what a Mixpanel event might look like. The event name should intuitively describe the user action or behavior that triggers this event.

Along with the video overview, you can also take a look at this [Mixpanel Data Model Board] (https://mixpanel.com/project/2195193/view/139237/app/boards/#id=4600772/) in a sample Mixpanel project for an in-depth explanation and to see how events and event properties can look within the platform. 

For a comprehensive overview of events and properties, please find 
[Events and Properties](/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties).

## Creating a Tracking Plan
to-do: video on how to make a copy + what the different fields means and how to think through it ( 3mins should be sufficient)
share link to our current docs where we keep examples of tracking plans

### Overview 
Mixpanel recommends creating a tracking plan based on the key business goals identified from your analytics strategy. It should:

- Serve as a centralized document that should serve as the source of truth on your Mixpanel implementation
- Define your business goals / KPIs and analytics strategy metrics. For a deeper dive into how you can map your KPIs to your specific user flows, you may want to explore our [Analytics Strategy Measurement Framework guide](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/best-practices/analytics-strategy/overview)
- Outline the events, event properties, and user profile properties aligned to your metrics. To dive deeper into understanding your events and properties, take a look at our [Events and Properties](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties)
- Be treated as a living and shared document that is continuously updated with any implementation changes
- Include notes that are referenced across teams (product, marketing, data science, tech / dev teams, etc.)
