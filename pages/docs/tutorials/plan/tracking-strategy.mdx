 # Build Your Tracking Strategy

## The Mixpanel Data Model

### The Building Blocks: Events and Event Properties
Events are the foundation of the Mixpanel Data Model. In order to conduct meaningful analysis and gather insights from Mixpanel reports, you should understand and intentionally design your events and event properties based on business objectives, specific use cases, and key metrics.

The main components of the events and event properties are outlined below: 
* All events should have an event name, a timestamp, and a distinct user ID. 
* Events represent an interaction between the user and your product. Include only relevant events that align to your use cases.    
* Event properties provide additional context or details about the event. Include only relevant event properties that will enable you drill deeper into the analysis.

Below are some examples of the Mixpanel event structure along with some relevant event properties. The event name should intuitively describe the user action or behavior that triggers this event.

Along with the Data Model Overview video, you can find this [Mixpanel Data Model Board](https://mixpanel.com/project/2195193/view/139237/app/boards/#id=4600772/) in a sample Mixpanel project which offers both an in-depth explanation as well as a glimpse into events and event properties live-in-action within the platform. 

For a comprehensive overview of events and properties, please find 
[Events and Properties](/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties).

### Understanding Special Properties 

**Super Properties**: In some cases, you may have certain relevant properties in which you may want to include with every event you send.  Unlike regular event properties, which are tied to individual events, super properties remain constant across multiple events, providing overarching context or information about the user or their environment.

These attributes are typically more about the user such as age, gender, source, or perhaps subscription plan type. Mixpanel allows you to register these properties as super properties so you can just let us know once, and these properties will be included in all subsequent events. 

Check out the link to find more information on 
[Super Properties](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript#super-properties).

**Reserved Properties**: Mixpanel have some properties that are reserved for special use or processing within our UI. 

Check out the link to find more information on [Reserved Properties](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties#reserved-event-properties).

**Default Properties**: If you are specifically using the Mixpanel client-side SDKs, we will automatically collect certain properties on every event where possible. 

Check out the link to find more information on [Default Properties](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/data-structure/property-reference).

### User Profile and User Properties
In addition to your events and event properties, User Profiles allow you to capture and store user attributes as user properties which can help with better understanding the persona and relevant characteristics about individual users. Again, you will only want to include relevant attributes that serve the purpose of helping you in meaningful analysis aligned to your key use cases. 

User Profiles are a separate table that uses the distinct user ID to thread all the user events or behaviors along with the user properties. 

Some common user properties are usually demographic information or user preferences and may include attributes such as user age, email address, subscription plan type, company role, or lifetime value. 

Check out the link to find more information on [User Profiles](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/data-structure/user-profiles).

### Group Analytics
At the fundamental level, Mixpanel allows behavioral data analysis at the individual user level. Group Analytics is an add-on feature that allows you to conduct analysis at a customized group level such as company, account, device, or any other group entity that makes sense for your business use case. 

Similar to how each individual user event must have a distinct ID sent as an event property, **every relevant group event should also have a distinct group ID, such as Company ID or an Account ID sent along as a event property with each event**. Mixpanel will then thread all group level behaviors to enable you to conduct analysis at the group level. 

Additionally, just like each user can have a User Profile, each group can also have a Group Profile that capture and store meaningful group attributes to better understand the group level attributes. For example, a Company Profile may include group properties such as industry, company size, annual spend, or number of seats.

Keep in mind that not every business necessarily has use cases that may require Group Analytics.

## Creating a Tracking Plan

### Overview 
Now that we have an understanding of the Mixpanel Data Model, going through this following guide should help you understand the necessary concepts and steps to build out your own tracking plan as it aligns to your business goals defined from your [Analytics Strategy Framework] (/framework.mdx). 

Your completed tracking plan will help you to: 
- Define your business goals / KPIs and analytics strategy metrics. 
- Outline the events, event properties, and user profile properties aligned to your metrics. 
- Be treated as a living and shared document that is continuously updated with any implementation changes
- Include notes that are referenced across all key stakeholders

### Tracking Plan Methodology
Prioritize and be intentional with your data based on your business goals and key use cases. You can create a comprehensive tracking plan, but make sure to identify the key objectives, the KPIs, and the events and properties for your onboarding. 

Having a clear alignment on priorities will allow you to move quickly in a phased approach to your implementation.

#### Example of Focused Use Cases 
A successful onboarding typically focuses on one or two key use cases. Some examples can be:
- the registration or sign up process
- a required activation or account set up journey
- the purchase funnel
- an important engagement journey (watching content, creating a playlist, planning a route, importing files to your platform, setting up an integration)

#### Map KPIs to User Flows
Map each of your metrics to the steps or specific actions that users take to influence each metric. For example, sign up flow will be important when measuring KPIs related to new user acquisition. Consider all the different user paths users can take and what specific measures will allow you to track, measure, and improve the expected desired user outcomes across activation, engagement, and/or retention. 

Having specific questions that you want to answer will help you think through which specific events are relevant and important to include. 

#### Identity Management 
As you go through building out your tracking plan, be sure to consider where you will need to manage user identity.

In short summary, when a user goes from being anonymous to when that user completes registration or and logs in, you will want to properly identify this user with a distinct ID.  For a full understanding of this critical concept, please review our [Identity Management guide here](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-methods/identifying-users)

#### Translate Flows into Event/Properties
Breakdown your user flows into events (actions) and properties (context of these actions) in your tracking plan. This will ensure that you have scoped out the data you need to achieve your KPIs / metrics in Mixpanel.

</p>

#### Define Naming Convention
Defining a naming convention will help maintain data quality and trust over time. Having an intuitive and easy to understand naming convention helps end users more easily make sense of the data. Also, remember that Mixpanel is case sensitive (e.g., sign up completed vs. Sign Up Completed will show up as two separate events).

It can be helpful to document the naming convention guidelines so everyone can be aware and adhere to these.

Here are a few simple guidelines to help you think through how to structure your naming convention:

- **Consistent**: make sure the name is standard across your different event names and properties as well as across your platforms.
- **Concise**: keep things short and simple but informative.
- **Clean**: the data should be easily understood that is case-sensitive.

You may want to avoid abbreviations or specific jargon that may not be immediately or easily understandable.

You can find more information on events and properties naming conventionÂ [best practices](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties#best-practices).

#### Event Name Depth 
When designing your data schema, you will also want to determine the proper level of event depth. As you determine what user actions to track, you'll want to strike the right balance to make sure events are not too specific or too broad.

### Building Your Tracking Plan
Mixpanel provides the following templates for vertical-specific tracking plans:

- [Retail and E-commerce](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kyys37m_GEL79_1BKKEnU5KxK91NF04kY-L_bFfcfqE/edit#gid=1484002407)
- [Media and Entertainment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K9t53kJJjaBG36kCIbZn_qKjXR9Iy306zYZAqDrv_AM/edit?usp=sharing)
- [SaaS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5wm5MKzRfSOZfUfCAg8YpePiz8Jn3Ar_u8KBo5lD6g/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Financial Services](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oGv6vbIFiYbima9IX4ItpBJvuChs-zzh83MRt_dSPgg/edit?usp=sharing)

You can also access a copy of aÂ [blank Tracking PlanÂ from here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZdOZ6TMtRPxy7qRxiLsvH9HWcHJM6nZydWKoThRxFKc/edit#gid=1641519238). Save a copy to your device to get started on your tracking plan.

### Building Your Visual User Flow 
Along with the tracking plan templates in your traditional spreadsheet format, you can also build out a visual user journey flow version of a tracking plan using tools like FigJam, Miro, or other similar products.

This can be a helpful exercise because you can visually understand the specific screens or page views, the exact steps in the user journey, and which actions trigger the user behavior to be tracked as an event. 

Here is an example of aÂ [User Journey in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/tYEeeRE0Xz6IampBhGLotw/Media-and-Entertainment-Tracking-Plan?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=ShUKEHAG2PlL9wNa-1)**.**
