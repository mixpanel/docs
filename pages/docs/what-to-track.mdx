# What to Track

In this guide, we provide some guidance on what to track and how to track it.

## Start With 2 Events
We recommend starting with just 2 events, which can provide a lot of value with little effort:

* **Sign Up** - Tracking Sign Up is a quick way to understand your product's growth; by counting the number 
of Sign Ups, you can answer "How many new users am I acquiring every day, week, and month?".

* **Value Moment** - Tracking a value moment can help you assess how well your product is doing. You can
answer questions like "How many users experience value in my product each day/week/month?" or
"How many users come back (retain) and experience the moment again?".

### Choose a Value Moment

Value moments are often the use of important features or taking a critical action. Here are some examples:
* **Social**: Post Created, Friend Added
* **E-Commerce**: Purchase Completed
* **Media**: Video Watched, Article Read
* **SaaS**: Document Created, Call Started

We recommend keeping your event names short and descriptive. We like to use the Object-Action convention, as you can see
in the above examples.

### Include Properties
Properties add context to the event. We recommend these properties for your two events:

**Sign Up**
  * **Source** (e.g Referral, Organic, Paid)
  * **Country** (e.g. United States, Vietnam, Germany) 
  * **OS** (e.g. Windows, iOS, Android) 

**Value Moment**
  * Up to you! This will depend greatly on your value moment. A `Video Watched` event may benefit from a `Duration` property.
  A `Message Liked` event may benefit from a `Message Type` property.

## We Recommend Server-Side Tracking
Adblockers and browsers are making it harder and harder to track users on the client-side. 
If you want to make sure the data you're collecting is accurate, you'll want to do most of 
your tracking server-side.

**Frontend event tracking (especially on the web) loses between 15% and 30% of events**. 
If you're only tracking on the client-side, you're missing out on a lot of data, even if you're 
using a reverse proxy.
