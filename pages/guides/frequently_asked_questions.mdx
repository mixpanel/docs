## Sending Data to Mixpanel

<div className="faqComponent" >

<FAQBox title="Why can’t I see any data in my Mixpanel project?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  There are several common reasons why you might not see any data in your Mixpanel project:

    1. **Incorrect Project Token** - Using the wrong project token in your initialization code will lead to your tracked data not arriving to your project. Always verify that the token matches [the token shown in your project settings](/docs/orgs-and-projects/managing-projects#find-your-project-tokens).
    2. **Mismatched Data Residency** - If your Mixpanel project data residency setting does not match the API endpoint you are sending data to, your data will **not be ingested**. If your project data residency is set to EU or India, make sure to route your data to the correct API server URL in your initialization code. Learn more about [EU Residency](/docs/privacy/eu-residency) and [India Residency](/docs/privacy/in-residency).
    3. **Implementation Issues** - Implementation errors can prevent Mixpanel SDK methods from triggering as expected. To help identify and resolve these issues during development, [enable debug mode in your SDK](/docs/tracking-best-practices/debugging#enable-debug-mode). This will provide logs of the Mixpanel requests being triggered, along with the associated payloads.

  Learn more about [debugging your implementation](/docs/tracking-best-practices/debugging).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="What methods are available for importing data into Mixpanel?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  You can use any [Mixpanel SDKs](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks) to track and send events directly from your applications, both on the client and server side.

  Mixpanel supports direct imports from data warehouses such as Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and Databricks through [Warehouse Connectors](/docs/tracking-methods/warehouse-connectors). You can set up [recurring syncs](/docs/tracking-methods/warehouse-connectors#sync-modes) to keep Mixpanel in sync with your warehouse data.

  If you use a CDP like Segment or Rudderstack, you can add Mixpanel as a downstream destination to receive your data. Learn more about [data ingestion integrations](/docs/tracking-methods/integrations).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How does ad-blockers affect Mixpanel tracking?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  Ad-blockers can significantly affect Mixpanel tracking, particularly when using the client-side JavaScript SDK. These blockers and privacy extensions often target known analytics endpoints (such as Mixpanel's), preventing events from being sent and recorded. As a result, users with ad blockers enabled may not be tracked in Mixpanel, leading to discrepancies between backend data and Mixpanel reports. Depending on your audience and the types of blockers in use, an estimated 30% or more of client-side events may be impacted.

  To reduce the impact of ad-blockers, use server-side tracking for critical events (server-side requests are not subject to ad blocking) and implement a proxy server to route client-side requests through your own domain (making them less likely to be blocked).
  
  Read more about [the differences between client-side and server-side tracking](/docs/tracking-methods/choosing-the-right-method).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How do I exclude bots from my tracking?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  By default, [Mixpanel's JavaScript SDK](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript) automatically blocks traffic from known web crawlers, as listed [here](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-js/blob/8ac526e5cb8563d11e2206046ab986c6491ac6d7/src/utils.js#L900C1-L925C3). All other traffic is processed normally and ingested into your project.

  To further control bot traffic, you can implement custom filtering in your code. This involves identifying common patterns among your bots and setting the super property `$ignore: true` to exclude those events at ingestion. 
  
  Learn more about [managing bot traffic](/docs/tracking-best-practices/bot-traffic).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Why are my user profiles all set to the same location?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  If all user profiles in Mixpanel display the same location, it is likely because you are sending data through a server-side implementation or a CDP (like Segment or Rudderstack). In these cases, Mixpanel uses the server's IP address for geolocation instead of the end user's, resulting in all users being assigned the same location (such as Boardman, Oregon for Segment or Ashburn, Virginia for Rudderstack).

  By default, Mixpanel updates a user's geolocation each time a user property is created or modified. If you don't explicitly include the user's real IP address in your payload, Mixpanel defaults to the server's IP.

  To resolve this, you can:
    - Pass the actual client IP using the `$ip`  in your payload,
    - Manually set geolocation properties like `$city`, `$region`, and `$country_code`, or
    - Set `$ip` to `0` to prevent Mixpanel from updating the geolocation entirely.

  Learn more about [geolocation](/docs/tracking-best-practices/geolocation) and other [server-side implementation best practices](/docs/tracking-best-practices/server-side-best-practices).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How do I override the default geolocation set by Mixpanel when sending data from a server?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  By default, Mixpanel determines the geolocation of users and events based on the IP address of the request. When using client-side tracking, this reflects the end user's location. With server-side tracking, it reflects the server's location.

  To override the default geolocation set by Mixpanel, you can:
    - Pass the actual client IP using the `$ip`  in your payload
    - Manually set geolocation properties such as `$city`, `$region`, and `$country_code`
    - Specify the exact coordinates by setting the `$latitude` and `$longitude` properties in your payload
  
  Learn more about [geolocation](/docs/tracking-best-practices/geolocation).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How do I track downloads and installs from Apple App Store and Google Play Store?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  Tracking downloads and installs from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in Mixpanel cannot be done directly, as neither app store provides this data to Mixpanel out-of-the-box.

  **For Google Play Store (Android):** You can use the [**Play Install Referrer Library**](https://developer.android.com/google/play/installreferrer/library) to retrieve the referrer URL when the app is first opened. This allows you to capture some attribution data (such as campaign source) and send it to Mixpanel as event properties. However, this only works for a subset of attribution data and does not provide the total number of downloads—only installs where the app is opened and the referrer is available

  **For Apple App Store (iOS):** The App Store strips attribution data before the user downloads the app, so you cannot directly track the source or count of installs via Mixpanel. To track channel attribution on iOS, you need to use a mobile attribution partner (such as Adjust, AppsFlyer, or Branch). These partners can capture install and attribution data and send it to Mixpanel for analysis.

  Learn more about [Traffic Attribution](docs/tracking-best-practices/traffic-attribution) and our [attribution integration partners](https://mixpanel.com/partners/integrations?categories=attribution-deep-linking).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How do I track first-touch UTM tags?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  To track first-touch UTM tags in Mixpanel, you can rely on the default behavior of the Mixpanel JavaScript SDK. When a user visits your site for the first time with UTM parameters in the URL, the SDK will:
    - Automatically capture the UTM parameters from the landing page URL (such as `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, etc.) and add them to events fired from that page load.
    - Store these first-seen UTM parameters as user profile properties prefixed with `initial_` (e.g., `initial_utm_source`, `initial_utm_campaign`). These properties represent the first-touch attribution and will persist on the user profile for future reference.

  **No extra configuration is needed** for first-touch tracking if you are using the default SDK settings and identifying users normally. The UTM parameters will be persisted as [super properties](/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties#super-properties) in a last-touch manner and the initial values will be set on the user profile automatically in a first-touch manner.

  If you are using a server-side implementation or a third-party integration, you must manually set these UTM properties.

  We recommend disabling UTM persistence for compatibility with the [Attribution](/docs/features/attribution) feature. To disable UTM persistence, set `stop_utm_persistence: true` when initializing the SDK.

  Learn more about [UTM tracking](/docs/tracking-best-practices/traffic-attribution#web-attribution).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How do I track last-touch UTM tags?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  By default, UTM parameters are persisted as [super properties](/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties#super-properties) in all events and is updated when a new UTM parameter is detected in subsequent page loads (which aligns with last-touch attribution).

  We recommend disabling UTM persistence for compatibility with the [Attribution](/docs/features/attribution) feature. To disable UTM persistence, set `stop_utm_persistence: true` when initializing the SDK.
  
  Learn more about UTM tracking [here](/docs/tracking-best-practices/traffic-attribution#web-attribution).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Why do I see Session Start and Session End events in my project?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  **Session Start** and **Session End** events are automatically computed based on the events already in your project. These are **virtual events;** they are not sent from your application but are generated by Mixpanel at query time within the UI and reports. These virtual events do not count toward your data allowance.

  The definition of a session, when it starts and ends, depends on your project's session settings, which may be [timeout-based](/docs/features/sessions#timeout-based-sessions), [event-based](docs/features/sessions#event-based-sessions), or [property-based](/docs/features/sessions#property-based-sessions). You can use these virtual events in reports such as Insights, Funnels, and Flows. However, they do not appear in your raw events list and cannot be exported via the API, as they are not stored as actual events in your data store.
  
  Learn more about [Sessions](/docs/features/sessions).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="What are super properties?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  [Super properties](/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties#super-properties) in Mixpanel are event properties that you define once and are automatically included with every event tracked from the client-side SDKs. They are stored in the user's local storage or cookie, so you don't need to manually add them to each event. This is useful for properties that provide important context across multiple events, such as user type, app version, or campaign source.

  You can register super properties with the [JavaScript SDK](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript#setting-super-properties), [Android SDK](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/android#setting-super-properties), [Swift SDK](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/swift#setting-super-properties), [iOS SDK](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/ios#setting-super-properties), and the [React SDK](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/react-native#setting-super-properties).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How can I edit the event data inside my project?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  You cannot directly edit the raw event data that has already been ingested into your Mixpanel project; events are immutable once received (unless imported via a [mirror sync warehouse connector](/docs/tracking-methods/warehouse-connectors#mirror). However, you can [hide unwanted events](/docs/data-governance/lexicon#hiding-data) from appearing in your reports and delete unwanted data.

  Learn more about the [Lexicon](/docs/data-governance/lexicon), [Data Deletion](/docs/data-governance/data-clean-up#2-deleting-problematic-data), and [Warehouse Connectors](/docs/tracking-methods/warehouse-connectors).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How can I send data from my data warehouse to Mixpanel?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  You can send data from your data warehouse to Mixpanel using [Warehouse Connectors](/docs/tracking-methods/warehouse-connectors), which offer native integrations with Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks. This codeless setup allows you to configure recurring syncs, ensuring Mixpanel stays up to date with your warehouse data.
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How can I do a one-time import of historic events? How much does it cost?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  To do an initial import of data into Mixpanel, there are several methods available:

  **1. SDKs (Software Development Kits)**: You can use [Mixpanel's SDKs](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks) to send data directly from your application. This is a common approach for ongoing event tracking, but it can also be used for initial imports if you replay historical events through the SDKs. 

  **2. Import API**: Mixpanel provides an [Import API](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/import-events) that allows you to send data directly to Mixpanel. This method is managed by your team, and you can automate API calls to send data as needed. 

  **3. Data Warehouse Connector(Add-on)**: Mixpanel offers a [data warehouse connector](/docs/tracking-methods/warehouse-connectors) as an add-on for organizations on the Enterprise plan, which allows you to point Mixpanel to your data warehouse table, and Mixpanel manages the sync and cadence of data import. This is a managed solution and is easier for teams that want Mixpanel to handle the process. Contact your account manager to learn more about the pricing.

  Learn more about the pricing for historical events on the Billing & Pricing doc](/docs/pricing#is-old-event-data-billed-when-imported-to-mixpanel).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Why do I see CORS errors in the console when Mixpanel requests in my website?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors appear in your console when Mixpanel requests from your website are blocked by the browser's security policy. This typically happens because the Mixpanel server response does not include the necessary CORS headers (like `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) to allow your domain to access the resource.

  Mixpanel requires you to send cross-origin HTTP requests (requests sent to a different server than the one hosting your web application), so you need to setup your environment to allow this. Use browser developer tools to inspect the failed request and see which headers are missing or mismatched.
  
  Learn more about [CORS errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS/Errors).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How do we send data to Mixpanel?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  You can use [Mixpanel's SDKs](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks) to track and send events directly from your applications, both on the client and server side.

  Mixpanel supports direct imports from data warehouses such as Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and Databricks through [Warehouse Connectors](/docs/tracking-methods/warehouse-connectors). You can set up recurring syncs to keep Mixpanel in sync with your warehouse data.

  If you use a CDP like Segment or Rudderstack, you can add Mixpanel as a downstream destination to receive your data.

  Learn more about [Tracking Methods](/docs/tracking-methods).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Can Mixpanel integrate with our current data model or database?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  Mixpanel is flexible and can integrate with most data models or databases, either directly or through data transformation and import methods.

  If your data is stored in a data warehouse (such as BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake, or Databricks), Mixpanel's [Warehouse Connectors](/docs/tracking-methods/warehouse-connectors) allow you to sync tables or views from your warehouse into Mixpanel. This integration is codeless and can keep your Mixpanel data in sync with your backend systems

  If you are using a CDP such as Segment or Rudderstack, you can set Mixpanel as a downstream destination to stream data from your existing sources.

  Learn more about [Tracking Methods](/docs/tracking-methods).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How do we handle sensitive or private data?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  Mixpanel does not store personally identifiable information (PII) unless you explicitly choose to track it. You have full control over the data you send and should avoid including raw PII (such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers) unless absolutely necessary.

  Mixpanel also provides tools to help you honor user privacy, including options to support opt-out requests and manage data responsibly. Learn more about how to [protect user data](/docs/privacy/protecting-user-data).

  With [Data Views](/docs/data-governance/data-views-and-classification#data-views-overview), you can create filtered views of your project data and assign access to specific teams or users.

  Additionally, [Data Classification](/docs/data-governance/data-views-and-classification#data-classification) lets you mark certain properties as classified, restricting visibility to only authorized users within your project.
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="What is the best way to send both client-side and server-side events?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  The best practice for sending both client-side and server-side events in Mixpanel is to use a **hybrid approach**:
    - **Track critical business events (**such as purchases, sign-ups, and revenue events) **on the server side**. This ensures greater accuracy and reliability, as server-side events are not impacted by ad blockers, network interruptions, or client-side manipulation. Use Mixpanel’s server-side SDKs or direct API ingestion for this purpose.
    - **Track user interactions and UI events (**such as button clicks and page views) **on the client side**. These events reflect real-time user behavior that only occurs in the browser or app and are best captured using Mixpanel’s client-side SDKs.

  Learn more about [choosing the right tracking method](/docs/tracking-methods/choosing-the-right-method).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How do we ensure the data is accurate and implementation is correct?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  To ensure your Mixpanel data is accurate and your implementation is correct, follow these best practices:
  1. **Use Separate Development and Production Projects:** Always set up at least two Mixpanel projects, one for development and one for production. Implement and test all tracking in the development project first. This prevents test or incorrect data from polluting your production analytics. Learn more about setting up [developer environments](/docs/tracking-best-practices/developer-environments).
  2. **Validate Events and Properties:** Use Mixpanel's Events view to confirm that events are arriving as expected. Manually trigger events and search for them using user-level identifiers (like `distinct_id`). Inspect event properties for correctness, data type, and naming conventions (Mixpanel is case sensitive). Learn more about [debugging your implementation](/docs/tracking-best-practices/debugging).
  3. **Iterate and Update Tracking Plan:** After each product update or when adding new events, update your tracking plan, get sign-off from a data governance owner, and repeat the QA process in the development project before deploying to production. Learn more about [creating a tracking plan](/docs/tracking-best-practices/tracking-plan) and establishing [data standards](/docs/data-governance/data-standards).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How do I anonymize an actual known user?" section="Sending Data to Mixpanel">
  Mixpanel does not require any identifying information about users. You can generate a hash of a unique user ID (such as your internal user ID) and use that hash as the user's ID when calling the `.identify()` method in the SDKs. This way, the user cannot be traced back to their real identity, but you can still analyze their behavior in aggregate. The hash should only be reversible by you, not by Mixpanel or anyone else.

  To anonymize a user who has already been tracked, first export all data associated with that user. Then, delete the user's data using Mixpanel's GDPR-compliant deletion methods. After reviewing the exported data, remove any personally identifiable information (PII), and reimport the sanitized data as needed once the deletion has been fully processed.

  Learn more about [anonymizing users](/docs/privacy/protecting-user-data#anonymizing-users) and submitting [GDPR requests](/docs/privacy/end-user-data-management).
</FAQBox>

</div>

## Identity Management in Mixpanel

<div className="faqComponent" >

<FAQBox title="What is a distinct_id?" section="Identity Management in Mixpanel">
  Distinct ID is Mixpanel's identifier used to uniquely track a user in the system. Every event data and profile update sent to Mixpanel should have a distinct_id property associated with it. The Distinct ID value tells Mixpanel which user to attach your events and profile property updates.

If the Distinct ID on two events are two different values, they will be considered as coming from two separate users.

</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How is distinct_id generated?" section="Identity Management in Mixpanel">
  Mixpanel's client-side SDKs automatically generates a UUID upon initialization to represent the user while they are anonymous. Once they are identified with a `.identify(<USER_ID>)` call, their distinct_id is set to your chosen user ID.
  
  In a server-side environment, your server is responsible for generating the distinct_ids for your users.

Learn more about [distinct_ids](/docs/tracking-methods/id-management/identity-management#distinct-id) and [identifying users](/docs/tracking-methods/id-management/identifying-users-simplified).

</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Where are distinct_id stored?" section="Identity Management in Mixpanel">
  In the client-side (web or mobile), Mixpanel's SDK will generate a cookie/local storage upon initialization and store the distinct_id for the user there. If the cookie/local storage is cleared, a new distinct_id will be generated.

In the server-side, your server is responsible for generating and maintaining the distinct_id.

Learn more about [ID management](/docs/tracking-methods/id-management/identity-management) and [identifying your users in your implementation](/docs/tracking-methods/id-management/identifying-users-simplified).

</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="What is the best practice for handling user identity in a client-side implementation?" section="Identity Management in Mixpanel">
  When implementing Mixpanel using a client-side SDK (web or mobile), we recommend calling `.identify(<USER_ID>)` at registration and login, and `.reset()` at logout. 
    
  Learn more about client-side ID management [here](/docs/tracking-methods/id-management/identifying-users-simplified#client-side-identity-management).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox
  title="What is the best practice for handling user identity in a server-side implementation?"
  section="Identity Management in Mixpanel"
>
  When implementing Mixpanel using a server-side method, your server is
  responsible for identity management meaning you will need to generate your own
  IDs. Learn more about server-side ID management
  [here](/docs/tracking-methods/id-management/identifying-users-simplified#server-side-identity-management).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How do I setup cross-domain tracking with Mixpanel?" section="Identity Management in Mixpanel">
  Mixpanel does not natively support cross-domain tracking. This is because the Distinct ID is stored in the Mixpanel cookie and cookies do not transfer across domains.

Some users have found the workaround outlined [here](https://muffaddal-qutbuddin.medium.com/cross-domain-tracking-in-mixpanel-analytics-cfa5e7fe86b6) helpful for connecting behavior across multiple domains.

Here is a high-level overview of this process:

1. User lands on website A, and generates a cookie containing a Mixpanel-created distinct_id
2. Use `mixpanel.get_distinct_id()` (learn more [here](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-js/blob/master/doc/readme.io/javascript-full-api-reference.md#mixpanelget_distinct_id)) to retrieve the distinct_id and save it as a variable
3. Pass this variable as a URL parameter in the URL to website B
4. Your user navigates to the website B, and generates a new cookie containing another Mixpanel-created distinct_id
5. In website B, insert code to extract the website A distinct_id from the landing page URL of website B
6. In website B, call the `.identify()` method, passing in the Website A distinct_id

</FAQBox>

<FAQBox
  title="How do I setup cross-subdomain tracking with Mixpanel?"
  section="Identity Management in Mixpanel"
>
  The Mixpanel Javascript SDK supports cross-subdomain tracking out-of-box,
  meaning that your super properties and distinct_id will persist across your
  subdomains. Learn more about cross-subdomain cookie persistence
  [here](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks/javascript#mixpanel-cookies-for-hosted-subdomains).
</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="How do I setup consistent user tracking across multiple platforms, such as a website and an app?" section="Identity Management in Mixpanel">
  Mixpanel's client-side SDKs will generate a different ID for each instance of the an initialized library, meaning that your users will have a separate `$distinct_id` in the website and mobile app without any identification. To ensure that the same user’s events in both platforms are resolved back to the same user profile in Mixpanel, call `.identify(<user_id>)` using the same `user_id` in both platforms.

See an example cross-platform ID management flow [here](Learn more about ID management here (/docs/tracking-methods/id-management/identifying-users-simplified#example-user-flows).

</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Why is the distinct_id shown in Mixpanel different from the ID I used to identify the user?" section="Identity Management in Mixpanel">
  If you are using the [Original ID Merge API](/docs/tracking-methods/id-management/identity-management#identity-merge-apis) (check your project API [here](https://mixpanel.com/settings/project/id-management)), our API chooses one of the IDs inside the identity cluster to serve as the canonical distinct_id for the user, meaning that it can be set to your chosen user ID or one of the Mixpanel-generated anonymous ID. This is programmatically selected by Mixpanel and not user-configurable.

You can use any of the distinct_ids inside of the identity cluster for ingestion, but only the canonical distinct_id is used in queries and exports. As a best practice, we recommend setting your chosen user ID as a super property and profile property to make querying easier.

</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Why do I see data from 2 different users under a single Mixpanel profile?" section="Identity Management in Mixpanel">
  This can occur for projects using the [Original ID Merge API](/docs/tracking-methods/id-management/identity-management#identity-merge-apis) when multiple users are sharing one device and `.reset()` was not called upon logout. Since the previous user’s `distinct_id` was not cleared from local storage via `.reset()`, the subsequent user’s user ID is merged into the previous user’s identity cluster when once they sign in and `.identify()` is called.

To prevent this, follow our best practice for identity management and call identify at registration/login, and reset at logout.

This is not possible under the Simplified ID Merge API since 2 different `$user_ids` cannot be merged under 1 identity cluster.

</FAQBox>

<FAQBox title="Why do I see 2 duplicated Mixpanel user profiles sharing the same email value?" section="Identity Management in Mixpanel">
  This is usually caused by multiple different user IDs being passed for the same user during identification. For example, if you identify the same user using the ID `ABC` in the web and `123` in the mobile app, they will be considered 2 different users by Mixpanel since we would have no way of knowing they are the same users.

As a best practice, only 1 consistent unique identifier for each user across all platforms during the identification process.
