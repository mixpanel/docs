## A–Z Glossary

### Active User
A user who interacts with your product within a defined period, [measured via event-based tracking](/docs/data-structure/events-and-properties) as Daily (DAU), Weekly (WAU), or Monthly Active Users (MAU).

### Annotation
Contextual notes added to reports to [mark key events](/docs/features/annotations)—such as releases, campaigns, or anomalies—directly on the timeline.

### Autocapture
A low-code feature that [automatically collects](/docs/tracking-methods/autocapture) standard user interactions—such as page views, clicks, form submissions, and scrolls—without the need for manual instrumentation.

### Business Associate Agreement (BAA)
A legal contract that [defines how vendors handle Protected Health Information (PHI)](https://mixpanel.com/legal/mixpanel-hipaa/) in compliance with HIPAA regulations.

### Business to Business (B2B)
A commercial model where products or services are sold to other companies rather than individual consumers.

### Business to Consumer (B2C)
A commercial model where products or services are sold directly to individual consumers rather than companies.

### Board
A collaborative workspace that [centralizes saved reports and metrics](/docs/boards) into a single view for real-time monitoring.

### Bounce Rate
A metric tracking the percentage of [sessions with only a single page view](/docs/features/sessions#what-are-the-average-number-of-pages-visited-per-session), often utilized to signal low engagement or friction in the onboarding experience.

### Daily Active Users (DAU)
A metric tracking the number of distinct users who engage with your product in a single day, used to [measure daily engagement and growth](https://mixpanel.com/blog/daily-active-users/).

### Data Lake
A centralized repository that stores raw, unstructured data at scale, which offers flexibility but requires transformation before it can be utilized for analysis.

### Data Warehouse
A system optimized for storing structured data, which can be [ingested directly into Mixpanel](/docs/tracking-methods/warehouse-connectors) for fast analysis and reporting.

### Dormant User
A user who engaged in a previous period but has not performed a key action in the current one, often [identified via cohort analysis](https://mixpanel.com/blog/cohort-analysis/) to target reactivation campaigns.

### Feature Flag
A configuration tool that [toggles feature availability](/docs/featureflags) for specific segments, enabling targeted rollouts and A/B testing without code deployment.

### First-party Cookies
A data file stored directly by the website the user is visiting, essential for maintaining persistent user identity and session continuity without relying on external trackers.

### Formula
A custom expression that [modifies or combines data series](/docs/features/formulas)—such as dividing total revenue by user count—to calculate derived metrics and ratios.

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
A comprehensive European Union regulation governing personal data privacy, supported in Mixpanel via [dedicated compliance tools](https://mixpanel.com/legal/mixpanel-gdpr/) for processing and deletion.

### Groups
A data structure that [aggregates user activity by entity](/docs/data-structure/group-analytics)—such as companies, teams, or devices—to analyze performance at the group level rather than the individual user level.

A United States federal law mandating the security and privacy of Protected Health Information (PHI), accommodated via [HIPAA-compliant plans](https://mixpanel.com/legal/mixpanel-hipaa/) for customers handling medical data.

### Identity Management
The process of associating events with specific users by [resolving unique identifiers](/docs/tracking-methods/id-management), typically using the `identify()` method to merge anonymous activity into a unified profile across devices.

### Ingestion
The transmission of event data into the analytics platform, accepted via [client-side SDKs](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks), the [Ingestion API](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/ingestion-api), or [partner integrations](/docs/tracking-methods/integrations).

### Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL)
A prospect who has demonstrated sufficient engagement or fit to be [handed off to sales](https://mixpanel.com/blog/marketing-qualified-leads/) for further qualification.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The most basic version of a product released to validate core assumptions and test concepts with real users before full-scale development.

### Monthly Active Users (MAU)
A metric tracking the number of distinct users who engage with a product within a 30-day window, used to [assess long-term growth trends](https://mixpanel.com/blog/mau/).

### Month-over-Month (MOM)
A comparative metric that measures the percentage change in performance between the current month and the previous one to identify growth momentum or seasonality.

### Multivariate Test
An experimentation method that [evaluates multiple variable combinations simultaneously](/docs/experiments)—rather than just two versions—to determine how different elements interact to influence user behavior.

### Net Promoter Score (NPS)
A standard loyalty metric that gauges customer satisfaction by asking users to rate their likelihood of recommending the product on a typical scale of 0 to 10.

### New User
A user who is recorded for the first time within a specific time window—such as a signup week or first session—tracked to measure acquisition success and onboarding efficacy.

### Protected Health Information (PHI)
Health-related data linked to a specific individual, which is [protected under HIPAA](https://mixpanel.com/legal/mixpanel-hipaa/) and requires a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) for processing by vendors.

### Personally Identifying Information (PII)
Any data that can directly or indirectly distinguish a specific individual—such as names, emails, or IPs—often requiring [specific privacy configurations](/docs/privacy/protecting-user-data) to ensure data security.

### Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ)
A comparative metric that measures the percentage change in performance between one fiscal quarter and the previous one to gauge short-term business momentum.

### Sales Qualified Lead (SQL)
A prospect who has been vetted by the sales team as ready for direct engagement, typically having graduated from the Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL) stage based on strong intent or fit.

### Session
A set of continuous user interactions, [grouped into a single visit](/docs/features/sessions) based on a time-out window or specific start and end events.

### Software Development Kit (SDK)
A package of code libraries that simplifies the process of [sending event data](/docs/tracking-methods/sdks) from client-side or server-side applications to the analytics platform.

### Stickiness
A measurement of engagement frequency that [calculates how often users return](/docs/reports/retention) to perform key actions within a specific interval, used to assess habit formation and product utility.

### Third-party Cookies
Data files set by external domains for advertising or cross-site tracking, which are [distinct from the first-party approach](https://mixpanel.com/blog/cookies-consent-and-the-gdpr-the-role-of-privacy-in-a-product-analytics-strategy/) prioritized by modern analytics to ensure privacy and reliability.

### Weekly Active Users (WAU)
A metric tracking the number of distinct users who engage with a product within a seven-day window, often monitored to [measure weekly engagement habits](https://mixpanel.com/blog/mau/).

### Year-over-Year (YoY)
