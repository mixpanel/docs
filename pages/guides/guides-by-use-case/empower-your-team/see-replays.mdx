# Turn Clicks into Clarity: Best Practices for Heatmaps & Session Replay

Discover what users really experience—and turn those insights into action. This Guide shows you how to use [Heatmaps](/docs/session-replay/heatmaps) and [Session Replay](/docs/session-replay) together to quickly spot friction, understand behavior, and drive better product decisions.

## What Are Heatmaps and Session Replay?

Heatmaps and Session Replay combine the “what” and the “why” of user behavior.

- Heatmaps show where users click and focus attention. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af7D3exv610)

- Session Replay shows how they move through your product in real time. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eig_Ta-0yZc)

Together, they help you understand not just *what* happened, but *why*.

## 1. Start with a Purpose

Begin with a clear goal instead of watching random replays. Ask:

- What behavior am I trying to understand?
- Which conversion, drop-off, or UX flow do I want to validate?

✅ **Do** define a specific question like:

- “Where are users dropping off in signup?”
- “Are people finding the new CTA?”
- “Do mobile users engage with the feature the same way as desktop users?”

❌ **Do not** assume watching any session will lead to insight. Without a clear question, you will end up chasing edge cases.

👉 **Do this next:** Define what “success” looks like before opening your first replay.

## 2. Use Heatmaps to Find the Pattern

Heatmaps are your first stop when you want to **see interaction trends at scale.**

**Steps to take:**

<Steps>

{<h3>Choose a meaningful page or flow, like signup, pricing, or onboarding.</h3>}

{<h3>Filter by device or cohort to compare how segments behave.</h3>}

{<h3>Scan for anomalies, such as ignored CTAs or clicks on non-interactive elements.</h3>}

</Steps>

    **Pro tip:** Use *Click Maps* for precision and *Traditional Heatmaps* for broader engagement patterns. Click Maps provide precise insights on dynamic pages with modals or dropdowns.
</Callout>

## 3. Use Session Replay to Understand the “Why”

Once you have spotted a pattern, Session Replay lets you zoom in on the granular details of individual user sessions.

**Steps to take:**

<Steps>

{<h3>Filter replays by key event or cohort.</h3>}

For example, you can filter to “users who dropped after viewing pricing.”

{<h3>Watch 6–8 replays.</h3>}

This allows you to identify friction points and common paths your users take.

{<h3>Look for behavioral feedback.</h3>}

This includes excessive scrolling, hesitation, backtracking, or repeated form errors that highlights friction points.

{<h3>Document your findings.</h3>}

Take notes on where users struggle or deviate from expected behavior.

</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
    **Pro tip:** Start from within Mixpanel reports or user profiles to stay anchored to data—not anecdotes. You can click “View Replays” directly from an Event, Funnel, or User Profile to see related sessions immediately.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
    **Pitfall:** One replay ≠ one insight. Confirm patterns across multiple sessions before drawing conclusions.
</Callout>

## 4. Protect User Privacy and Data Integrity

Session Replay gives full visibility into user behavior—but it also introduces risk if sensitive data appears on-screen.

**Best practices for safe implementation:**

- Use Mixpanel's privacy controls to mask or block sensitive UI screens, like checkout or profile information. 
- Test across devices, especially for mobile SDKs and embedded web views.
- Review your company's privacy notice and legal compliance before roll-out.

## 5. Translate Insights into Product Decisions

Data becomes powerful only when shared. Once you identify friction, decide what change to make—and how you will measure its impact.

**Steps to take:**

<Steps>

{<h3>Summarize your insight.</h3>}

Turn observations into clear takeaways. For example, “Users abandon signup when validation errors are not visible.”

{<h3>Share replay clips to align stakeholders on the problem.</h3>}

Short, focused clips help everyone see the issue firsthand, creating a shared understanding and faster alignment on next steps.

{<h3>Instrument or adjust tracking if needed.</h3>}

Ensure what you are tracking capture key behaviors so you can validate results and spot new opportunities.

</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
    **Pro tip:** Create a recurring “Replay Review” with PMs and designers. It builds empathy and keeps teams aligned on real user behavior.
</Callout>

**Strengthen your workflow with related features:**

- [Annotations](/docs/features/annotations): Add notes to your reports to document findings and experiments.
- [Alerts](/docs/features/alerts): Set notifications for spikes or drops in engagement or friction.
- [Experiments](/docs/experiments): Validate your hypotheses by testing product changes and measuring lift.
