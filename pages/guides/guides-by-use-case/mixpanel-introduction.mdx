# Mixpanel Introduction

Mixpanel is a **digital analytics platform** that helps teams continuously improve their products by turning data into action. At its core, Mixpanel supports a **continuous innovation loop**—helping you observe what users do, analyze why it happens, decide what to do next, and act on those insights.

> **Why it matters:** Teams use Mixpanel to learn faster, align decisions across functions, and measure the impact of every product change.

## Mixpanel Features That Power Continuous Innovation

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', alignItems: 'center', gap: '24px', margin: '32px 0' }}>
  <div style={{ flex: '1 1 420px', minWidth: '280px' }}>

Mixpanel is built around a simple but powerful framework for continuous improvement: **Observe → Analyze → Decide → Act (OADA)**.

Each stage in the OADA framework connects directly to Mixpanel’s tools, helping you move from data to observation to action–—all in one platform.

| 👀 **Observe** | 📊 **Analyze** | 💡 **Decide** | 🚀 **Act** |
|---|---|---|---|
| See what’s happening in your product with [Session Replay](/docs/session-replay), [Heatmaps](/docs/session-replay/heatmaps), [Autocapture](/docs/tracking-methods/autocapture), and [Alerts](/docs/features/alerts). | Explore [Insights](/docs/reports/insights), [Funnels](/docs/reports/funnels), [Flows](/docs/reports/flows), [Retention](/docs/reports/retention), and [Cohorts](/docs/users/cohorts) to find what moves your metrics. | Align on what to change next with [Metric Trees](/docs/metric_tree), [Boards](/docs/boards), [Annotations](/docs/features/annotations), and shared insights. | Measure impact with [Experiments](/docs/experiments) and ship improvements with [Feature Flags](/docs/featureflags). |

All of this is powered by Mixpanel’s modern data foundation—–bringing together AI-assisted analysis through features like [MCP Server](/docs/features/mcp), robust [data governance](/docs/data-governance) for accuracy and trust, and built-in collaboration tools that help teams move from insight to action faster.

## Mixpanel Data Model

Everything in Mixpanel starts with **events**––the building blocks of your data model.
   
An event represents something a **user** does (like *Signed Up*, *Viewed a Product*, or *Completed Purchase*). Each event can include **properties** that add context, such as the user’s plan type, location, or device.

[Placeholder for full width image - either here or below this paragraph?]

Together, these events and properties form a flexible data model that mirrors how people actually use your product. Once instrumented, you can analyze this data instantly—–without writing SQL or waiting on an analyst.
