# Mixpanel Introduction

Mixpanel is a **digital analytics platform** that helps teams continuously improve their products by turning data into action.  
At its core, Mixpanel supports a **continuous innovation loop**—helping you observe what users do, analyze why it happens, decide what to do next, and act on those insights.

> **Why it matters:** Teams use Mixpanel to learn faster, align decisions across functions, and measure the impact of every product change.

## The Continuous Innovation Loop

Mixpanel is built around a simple but powerful framework for continuous improvement: **Observe → Analyze → Decide → Act (OADA)**.

This loop represents the cycle teams follow to turn data into action—first observing what users do, then analyzing why it happens, deciding what to do next, and finally acting on those insights to drive better outcomes.

| 👀 **Observe** | 📊 **Analyze** | 💡 **Decide** | 🚀 **Act** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Track the right events and understand user behavior. | Explore funnels, retention, and trends to find what drives engagement. | Align on opportunities using dashboards and metrics. | Launch experiments and measure impact to close the loop. |

## Event Data Model

Everything in Mixpanel starts with **events**––the building blocks of your data model.

An event represents something a **user** does (like *Signed Up*, *Viewed a Product*, or *Completed Purchase*). Each event can include **properties** that add context, such as the user’s plan type, location, or device.

Together, these events and properties form a flexible data model that mirrors how people actually use your product. Once instrumented, you can analyze this data instantly—–without writing SQL or waiting on an analyst.
