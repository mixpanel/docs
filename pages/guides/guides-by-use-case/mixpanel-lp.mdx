## The Continuous Innovation Loop (OADA)

The OADA loop is the foundation of how Mixpanel supports better, faster product decisions. Each phase represents a step teams take to close the feedback loop between data and action.

| 👀 **Observe** | 📊 **Analyze** | 💡 **Decide** | 🚀 **Act** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Track the right events and understand user behavior. | Explore funnels, retention, and trends to find what drives engagement. | Align on opportunities using dashboards and metrics. | Launch experiments and measure impact to close the loop. |
