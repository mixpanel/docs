## How Different Industries Use the Continuous Loop

Mixpanel powers the **Observe → Analyze → Decide → Act (OADA)** loop across every industry — helping teams turn data into confident action. 

Whether you’re optimizing user onboarding, increasing checkout conversions, or improving content engagement, the same continuous loop applies. 

Below are examples of how teams in different industries use Mixpanel to measure, learn, and grow faster.

<details>
<summary><strong>💼 SaaS: Improving Onboarding and Activation</strong></summary>

A SaaS team uses **Funnels**, **Flows**, and **Session Replay** to pinpoint where new users drop off during onboarding, then experiments with in-app guidance to boost activation and conversion.

### 👀 Observe
They track the key onboarding steps — *Account Created → Setup Complete → First Project Created* — to identify where users drop off.  
**Funnels** and **Flows** reveal that many sign-ups never finish creating their first project.

### 📊 Analyze
Using **Insights**, **Retention**, and **Session Replay**, they see users abandoning the setup due to unclear tracking plan instructions.

| Tool | Insight |
|------|----------|
| **Funnels** | 60% drop-off between “Setup Complete” → “First Project Created.” |
| **Session Replay** | Users hover over “Tracking Plan” but never click “Save.” |

### 💡 Decide
A **Metric Tree** shows that inviting teammates drives activation.  
They decide to surface a prompt encouraging users to invite others earlier.

### 🚀 Act
They run an **Experiment** introducing a tooltip—“Invite your teammate to collaborate”—and roll out the winning variant using **Feature Flags**.

**✨ Result:** Activation improves 15%, and time to value shortens.

<summary><strong>🛍️ eCommerce: Increasing Checkout Conversion</strong></summary>

An eCommerce team uses **Funnels** and **Insights** to identify checkout friction, **Session Replay** to understand user frustration, and **Experimentation** to improve mobile conversions.

### 👀 Observe
They map the funnel: *Product Viewed → Added to Cart → Checkout Started → Purchase Completed*.  
Drop-offs spike at checkout.

### 📊 Analyze
Segmenting by device, they find mobile users struggle most.  
**Session Replay** shows zooming and misclicks on the payment form.

| Observation | Insight |
|--------------|----------|
| 40% drop-off at payment | Payment form not optimized for mobile |
| Higher desktop conversion | Indicates design, not intent issue |

### 💡 Decide
A **Metric Tree** links revenue to “Discount Applied” and “Shipping Cost Viewed.”  
High shipping costs cause abandonment, prompting a pricing test.

### 🚀 Act
They A/B test new shipping thresholds with **Experimentation** and roll out successful results using **Feature Flags**.

**✨ Result:** Mobile checkout completion increases by 20%.

<summary><strong>🎬 Media & Entertainment: Boosting Viewer Retention</strong></summary>

A streaming platform uses **Funnels**, **Retention**, and **Session Replay** to improve viewer engagement and increase repeat visits.

### 👀 Observe
They track *Episode Started → Episode Completed → Next Episode Started* and notice drop-offs after Episode 2.

### 📊 Analyze
**Insights** and **Retention** reveal 70% of viewers don’t return after Episode 2.  
**Session Replay** shows poor “Up Next” recommendations.

| Tool | Finding |
|------|----------|
| **Retention** | Only 30% of users return for Episode 3 |
| **Heatmaps** | Users hover over “Recommended for You” but don’t click |

### 💡 Decide
**Metric Trees** connect “Episode Completion” to “Rated Episode.”  
Ratings correlate strongly with retention.

### 🚀 Act
They use **Experimentation** to test a “Rate this Episode” prompt and roll it out via **Feature Flags**.

**✨ Result:** Repeat viewership increases 25%.

<summary><strong>💰 Fintech: Increasing Feature Adoption and Retention</strong></summary>

A fintech product team tracks engagement with budgeting tools, analyzes setup drop-offs, and experiments with alerts to improve retention.

### 👀 Observe
They track *Linked Account → Created Budget → Reviewed Spending → Adjusted Budget*.  
Many users stop after linking an account.

### 📊 Analyze
**Session Replay** shows authentication errors for smaller banks.  
**Retention Reports** confirm users who finish linking are 2× more likely to stay active.

| Funnel Stage | Conversion Rate |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Linked Account → Created Budget | 45% |
| Created Budget → Reviewed Spending | 80% |

### 💡 Decide
A **Metric Tree** connects “Monthly Active Users” to “Set Budget Alert.”  
Users who set alerts retain longer, so the team focuses there.

### 🚀 Act
They test an alert prompt via **Experimentation** and release it progressively using **Feature Flags**.

**✨ Result:** Budgeting alert adoption increases 30%, retention rises 18%.

<summary><strong>🎮 Gaming: Driving Player Engagement and In-App Purchases</strong></summary>

A gaming studio observes where players churn, analyzes gameplay behavior, and experiments with prompts to drive engagement and purchases.

### 👀 Observe
They track *Level Started → Level Completed → In-App Purchase Made.*  
Most players quit after Level 3.

### 📊 Analyze
**Session Replay** and **Insights** reveal players miss key hints.  
Those who use power-ups complete more levels and spend more.

| Tool | Discovery |
|------|------------|
| **Session Replay** | Players ignore the “Hint” icon on Level 3 |
| **Insights** | Power-up users complete 2× more levels |

### 💡 Decide
Using **Metric Trees**, they find “Power-Up Usage” directly impacts “Revenue.”  
They plan to highlight power-ups before Level 3.

### 🚀 Act
They run an **Experiment** with a pre-level prompt and roll it out using **Feature Flags**.

**✨ Result:** Level completion improves 35%; in-app purchases rise 20%.
