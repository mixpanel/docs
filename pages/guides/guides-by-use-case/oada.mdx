## How Different Industries Use the Continuous Loop

Mixpanel powers the OADA loop across every industry--helping teams turn data into confident action. 

Whether you’re optimizing user onboarding, increasing checkout conversions, or improving content engagement, the same continuous loop applies. 

Below are examples of how teams in different industries use Mixpanel to measure, learn, and grow faster.


<details>
<summary><strong>💼 SaaS: Improving Onboarding and Activation</strong></summary>

<br></br>A SaaS team observes where new users drop off during onboarding, analyzes behavior to uncover friction points, decides which steps to simplify, and acts by testing improvements that drive activation and conversion.

---

**Observe** <br></br>
The team tracks the key onboarding steps — *Account Created → Setup Complete → First Project Created* — to identify where users drop off. **Funnels** and **Flows** reveal that many sign-ups never finish creating their first project.

---

**Analyze** <br></br>
Using **Insights**, **Retention**, and **Session Replay**, they see users abandoning the setup due to unclear tracking plan instructions.

| Tool | Insight |
|------|----------|
| **Funnels** | 60% drop-off between “Setup Complete” → “First Project Created.” |
| **Session Replay** | Users hover over “Tracking Plan” but never click “Save.” |

---

**Decide** <br></br>
A **Metric Tree** shows that inviting teammates drives activation. They decide to surface a prompt encouraging users to invite others earlier.

---

**Act** <br></br>
They run an **Experiment** introducing a tooltip--“Invite your teammate to collaborate”--and roll out the winning variant using **Feature Flags**.

---

**✨ Result:** Activation improves 15%, and time to value shortens.
<br></br>

<details>
<summary><strong>🛍️ eCommerce: Increasing Checkout Conversion</strong></summary>

<br></br>An eCommerce team observes how shoppers move through checkout, analyzes drop-offs to find mobile pain points, decides what changes to prioritize, and acts by launching experiments that lift conversion rates.

---

**Observe** <br></br>
They map the funnel: *Product Viewed → Added to Cart → Checkout Started → Purchase Completed*.  
Drop-offs spike at checkout.

---

**Analyze** <br></br>
Segmenting by device, they find mobile users struggle most.  
**Session Replay** shows zooming and misclicks on the payment form.

| Observation | Insight |
|--------------|----------|
| 40% drop-off at payment | Payment form not optimized for mobile |
| Higher desktop conversion | Indicates design, not intent issue |

---

**Decide** <br></br>
A **Metric Tree** links revenue to “Discount Applied” and “Shipping Cost Viewed.”  
High shipping costs cause abandonment, prompting a pricing test.

---

**Act** <br></br>
They A/B test new shipping thresholds with **Experimentation** and roll out successful results using **Feature Flags**.

---

**✨ Result:** Mobile checkout completion increases by 20%.
<br></br>

</details>



<details>
<summary><strong>🎬 Media & Entertainment: Boosting Viewer Retention</strong></summary>

A streaming platform observes how audiences engage with content, analyzes where viewers disengage, decides how to personalize recommendations, and acts by improving the experience to keep viewers watching longer.

---

**Observe** <br></br>
They track *Episode Started → Episode Completed → Next Episode Started* and notice drop-offs after Episode 2.

---

**Analyze** <br></br>
**Insights** and **Retention** reveal 70% of viewers don’t return after Episode 2.  
**Session Replay** shows poor “Up Next” recommendations.

| Tool | Finding |
|------|----------|
| **Retention** | Only 30% of users return for Episode 3 |
| **Heatmaps** | Users hover over “Recommended for You” but don’t click |

---

**Decide** <br></br>
**Metric Trees** connect “Episode Completion” to “Rated Episode.”  
Ratings correlate strongly with retention.

---

**Act** <br></br>
They use **Experimentation** to test a “Rate this Episode” prompt and roll it out via **Feature Flags**.

---

**✨ Result:** Repeat viewership increases 25%.<br></br>

</details>



<details>
<summary><strong>💰 Fintech: Increasing Feature Adoption and Retention</strong></summary>

A fintech product team tracks engagement with budgeting tools, analyzes setup drop-offs, and experiments with alerts to improve retention.

---

**Observe** <br></br>
They track *Linked Account → Created Budget → Reviewed Spending → Adjusted Budget*.  
Many users stop after linking an account.

---

**Analyze** <br></br>
**Session Replay** shows authentication errors for smaller banks.  
**Retention Reports** confirm users who finish linking are 2× more likely to stay active.

| Funnel Stage | Conversion Rate |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Linked Account → Created Budget | 45% |
| Created Budget → Reviewed Spending | 80% |

---

**Decide** <br></br>
A **Metric Tree** connects “Monthly Active Users” to “Set Budget Alert.”  
Users who set alerts retain longer, so the team focuses there.

---

**🚀 Act** <br></br>
They test an alert prompt via **Experimentation** and release it progressively using **Feature Flags**.

---

**✨ Result:** Budgeting alert adoption increases 30%, retention rises 18%.<br></br>

</details>



<details>
<summary><strong>🎮 Gaming: Driving Player Engagement and In-App Purchases</strong></summary>

A gaming studio observes where players churn, analyzes gameplay behavior, and experiments with prompts to drive engagement and purchases.

---

**Observe** <br></br>
They track *Level Started → Level Completed → In-App Purchase Made.*  
Most players quit after Level 3.

---

**Analyze** <br></br>
**Session Replay** and **Insights** reveal players miss key hints.  
Those who use power-ups complete more levels and spend more.

| Tool | Discovery |
|------|------------|
| **Session Replay** | Players ignore the “Hint” icon on Level 3 |
| **Insights** | Power-up users complete 2× more levels |

---

**Decide** <br></br>
Using **Metric Trees**, they find “Power-Up Usage” directly impacts “Revenue.”  
They plan to highlight power-ups before Level 3.

---

**Act** <br></br>
They run an **Experiment** with a pre-level prompt and roll it out using **Feature Flags**.

---

**✨ Result:** Level completion improves 35%; in-app purchases rise 20%.<br></br>

</details>

No matter your industry, the OADA loop helps you turn insights into action--and Mixpanel gives you the tools to complete that loop faster with every iteration.
