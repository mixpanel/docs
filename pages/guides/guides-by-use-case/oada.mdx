## How Different Industries Use the Continuous Loop

Mixpanel powers the OADA loop across every industry--helping teams turn data into confident action. 

Whether you’re optimizing user onboarding, increasing checkout conversions, or improving content engagement, the same continuous loop applies. 

Below are examples of how teams in different industries use Mixpanel to measure, learn, and grow faster.


<details>
<summary><strong>💼 SaaS: Improving Onboarding and Activation</strong></summary>

<br></br>A SaaS team observes where new users drop off during onboarding, analyzes behavior to uncover friction points, decides which steps to simplify, and acts by testing improvements that drive activation and conversion.

---

**Observe** <br></br>
The team tracks the onboarding journey (Account Created → Tutorial Completed → Key Action Taken) to understand where users get stuck. Using **Funnels** and **Flows** in Mixpanel, they see that a large portion of users drop off before finishing the tutorial.

---

**Analyze** <br></br>
They dig deeper with **Insights** and **Session Replay** to find out *why*. Behavioral data shows that most users abandon onboarding when asked to configure a complex setting too early, while replays confirm that this screen causes confusion.

| Tool | Observation | Insight |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Funnels & Flows** | High drop-off between “Account Created” and “Tutorial Completed” | Many users start onboarding but don’t reach the first key action, indicating friction early in the setup process. |
| **Insights** | Users who skip advanced configuration steps are more likely to activate | Complex setup tasks cause early abandonment before users reach value. |
| **Session Replay** | Users pause or exit on the configuration screen | The configuration step is confusing, creating hesitation and contributing to drop-offs. |


---

**Decide** <br></br>
The team compares **cohorts** of users who complete onboarding in their first session versus those who don’t. They find that users who finish onboarding right away are twice as likely to activate within a week. They decide to simplify the initial setup and move optional configuration to a later stage.

---

**Act** <br></br>
They run an **Experiment** testing a new guided flow that delays complex setup until after the user experiences initial value. After the winning version significantly improves activation, they roll it out to all users using **Feature Flags**.

---

**✨ Result:** Activation improves 15%, and time to value shortens.
<br></br>

<summary><strong>🛍️ eCommerce: Increasing Checkout Conversion</strong></summary>

<br></br>An eCommerce team observes how shoppers move through checkout, analyzes drop-offs to find mobile pain points, decides what changes to prioritize, and acts by launching experiments that lift conversion rates.

---

**Observe** <br></br>
The team maps the path to purchase (Product Viewed → Added to Cart → Checkout Started → Purchase Completed) to pinpoint where customers abandon the flow. Using **Funnels** in Mixpanel, they see that a large portion of users start checkout but never complete payment.

---

**Analyze** <br></br>
They investigate further with **Insights**, segmenting results by device and geography. Mobile users show significantly lower completion rates.

Through **Session Replay** and **Heatmaps**, they observe users zooming in on payment fields, misclicking form inputs, and abandoning the process after multiple failed attempts.

| Tool | Observation | Insight |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Funnels** | 40% drop-off at payment step | Many users abandon checkout before completing payment, indicating friction at this stage. |
| **Session Replay & Heatmaps** | Users zoom and misclick on payment fields | The form is difficult to complete on mobile, leading to frustration and abandonment. |
| **Insights** | Longer time on payment page before exit | Users struggle to enter details correctly, suggesting unclear field labels or validation errors. |


---

**Decide** <br></br>
The team compares cohorts of mobile users who completed checkout versus those who didn’t. They find that reducing the number of required fields correlates with higher conversion. They decide to simplify the payment form and surface popular payment options earlier in the flow.

---

**Act** <br></br>
They create an **Experiment** testing the simplified checkout form with mobile users. The results show a significant lift in mobile conversions, so the team rolls out the new design to all users using **Feature Flags**.

---

**✨ Result:** Checkout completion increases by 20%, and mobile users complete purchases faster with fewer errors..

<summary><strong>🎬 Media & Entertainment: Boosting Viewer Retention</strong></summary>

A streaming platform observes how audiences engage with content, analyzes where viewers disengage, decides how to personalize recommendations, and acts by improving the experience to keep viewers watching longer.

---

**Observe** <br></br>
They track *Episode Started → Episode Completed → Next Episode Started* and notice drop-offs after Episode 2.

---

**Analyze** <br></br>
**Insights** and **Retention** reveal 70% of viewers don’t return after Episode 2.  
**Session Replay** shows poor “Up Next” recommendations.

| Tool | Finding |
|------|----------|
| **Retention** | Only 30% of users return for Episode 3 |
| **Heatmaps** | Users hover over “Recommended for You” but don’t click |

---

**Decide** <br></br>
**Metric Trees** connect “Episode Completion” to “Rated Episode.”  
Ratings correlate strongly with retention.

---

**Act** <br></br>
They use **Experimentation** to test a “Rate this Episode” prompt and roll it out via **Feature Flags**.

---

**✨ Result:** Repeat viewership increases 25%.<br></br>

</details>



<details>
<summary><strong>💰 Fintech: Increasing Feature Adoption and Retention</strong></summary>

A fintech product team tracks engagement with budgeting tools, analyzes setup drop-offs, and experiments with alerts to improve retention.

---

**Observe** <br></br>
They track *Linked Account → Created Budget → Reviewed Spending → Adjusted Budget*.  
Many users stop after linking an account.

---

**Analyze** <br></br>
**Session Replay** shows authentication errors for smaller banks.  
**Retention Reports** confirm users who finish linking are 2× more likely to stay active.

| Funnel Stage | Conversion Rate |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Linked Account → Created Budget | 45% |
| Created Budget → Reviewed Spending | 80% |

---

**Decide** <br></br>
A **Metric Tree** connects “Monthly Active Users” to “Set Budget Alert.”  
Users who set alerts retain longer, so the team focuses there.

---

**🚀 Act** <br></br>
They test an alert prompt via **Experimentation** and release it progressively using **Feature Flags**.

---

**✨ Result:** Budgeting alert adoption increases 30%, retention rises 18%.<br></br>

</details>



<details>
<summary><strong>🎮 Gaming: Driving Player Engagement and In-App Purchases</strong></summary>

A gaming studio observes where players churn, analyzes gameplay behavior, and experiments with prompts to drive engagement and purchases.

---

**Observe** <br></br>
They track *Level Started → Level Completed → In-App Purchase Made.*  
Most players quit after Level 3.

---

**Analyze** <br></br>
**Session Replay** and **Insights** reveal players miss key hints.  
Those who use power-ups complete more levels and spend more.

| Tool | Discovery |
|------|------------|
| **Session Replay** | Players ignore the “Hint” icon on Level 3 |
| **Insights** | Power-up users complete 2× more levels |

---

**Decide** <br></br>
Using **Metric Trees**, they find “Power-Up Usage” directly impacts “Revenue.”  
They plan to highlight power-ups before Level 3.

---

**Act** <br></br>
They run an **Experiment** with a pre-level prompt and roll it out using **Feature Flags**.

---

**✨ Result:** Level completion improves 35%; in-app purchases rise 20%.<br></br>

</details>

No matter your industry, the OADA loop helps you turn insights into action--and Mixpanel gives you the tools to complete that loop faster with every iteration.
