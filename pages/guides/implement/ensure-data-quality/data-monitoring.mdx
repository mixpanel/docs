# Data Monitoring

Beyond Quality Assurance tests, maintaining a dashboard to track all incoming Mixpanel data is crucial for monitoring overall implementation progress and ensuring data integrity. This high-level data audit acts as an additional layer of quality assurance, allowing you to proactively identify and address potential data issues.

To assist you in this process, our Customer Success Team has created a Mixpanel Monitoring Dashboard that you can easily copy into your own project.

This dashboard provides key high-level statistics around your events, properties, and identity management, offering a comprehensive overview of your Mixpanel implementation and data health.

By utilizing this dashboard, you can gain valuable insights into your data and ensure that your Mixpanel implementation is on track and delivering accurate, actionable results.
