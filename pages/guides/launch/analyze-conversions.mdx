# Analyze Conversions
Use our [funnels](/docs/reports/funnels) report to analyze where your users convert, how long they take to do so, and what drives conversions.

To follow along the tutorials in this section, we've created [this board](https://mixpanel.com/project/3018488/view/3536632/app/boards/#id=6350527) in our demo project that you can copy into your own project. As you open the linked board, you will see instructions to click on "Use this board" to transfer it over to your project and to edit the default date range.

## Configuring Conversion Criteria
To utilize funnels correctly, it's important to understand how the [conversion criteria](/docs/reports/funnels#conversion-criteria) works and how it impacts the conversion rate depending on whether you use "unique" or "total" conversions. We have a couple of examples in [this board](https://mixpanel.com/project/3018488/view/3536632/app/boards/#id=6350527) to help explain and test your understanding of how the conversion criteria works. 

## Advanced Funnel Features
Go beyond looking at overall conversion, view conversion trend over time, distribution of the time it takes users to convert through the funnel or the number of times users complete any step before converting or dropping off. Add more specificity to your conversion criteria by holding a [property constant](/docs/reports/funnels#hold-property-constant) over steps or [exclude users who did a particular step](/docs/reports/funnels#exclusion-steps-exclude-users-who-did).

## Viewing as a Flow
Oftentimes, knowing what the conversion is or how it has changed over time is not actionable in of itself. Beyond creating cohorts on users who have dropped off to send them downstream to CRM tools for re-engagement, what marketers and product managers typically want to know is, where precisely did people drop off? What are the typical user flows or behavior that causes users to drop off? Learn more about it [here](/docs/reports/funnels#view-as-flow).
