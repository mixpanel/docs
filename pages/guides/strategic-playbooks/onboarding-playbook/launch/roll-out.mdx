# Roll Out Mixpanel with Confidence

Move from implementation to adoption with a clear plan for deploying, rolling out, and rallying your teams.

---

## Deploy to Production
Your Mixpanel setup is complete‚Äînow it is time to take it live. Deploying to production means you are connecting your tested implementation to your real, live user data.

### Reiterate Benefits

When you go live with Mixpanel, you enable your teams to:

- See **real user behavior** as it happens.
- Track **key activation and retention metrics**.
- Test **hypotheses quickly** with data-backed evidence.
- Build a **shared understanding** of product performance across teams.

Before rollout, remind stakeholders that this phase turns your tracking plan into tangible value. It is where insight begins.

### Deployment Checklist

For deployment, confirm that you‚Äôve:

- [Completed QA](/guides/guides-by-use-case/ensuring-data-quality) in your staging project.
- Prepared your [production project](/docs/orgs-and-projects/managing-projects#creating-projects).
- [Enabled tracking](/docs/quickstart/capture-events/track-events) in your production project.
- Triggered historical backfilling (if necessary).
- Monitored live data for any potential anomalies.
- Implemented your [data governance strategy](/docs/data-governance).
- [Granted production access](/docs/orgs-and-projects/roles-and-permissions#invite-users) to the correct users.

For a detailed, step-by-step version of this list, check out the full [Mixpanel Production Deployment Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12FJDLLTpOgw-5B4_EoA9coUkp6eM1kKAwr2mAgiNrds/edit?gid=751571839#gid=751571839). It covers everything from validation in staging to go-live monitoring.

    **Pro tip:** Keep a small monitoring window after deployment (24‚Äì48 hours) to catch any anomalies before promoting org-wide usage.

## Roll Out Mixpanel

Once your production deployment is verified, the focus shifts to planning for adoption‚Äîgetting the right people using Mixpanel effectively.

### Plan Your Adoption

Start with a short plan that outlines:

- **Key success metrics:** Decide what adoption looks like‚Äîe.g. weekly active Mixpanel users, reports viewed, or dashboard subscriptions.
- **Your launch goal:** For example, ‚ÄúEvery PM and designer logs into Mixpanel and saves a report within 1 week.‚Äù
- **Timeline:** Who needs access first, what happens on launch day, and how you will follow up.

<Callout type="info">
    **Pro tip:** Use the Mixpanel Usage report in Mixpanel Settings to monitor which teammates are actively using Mixpanel.

### Identify Stakeholders and Champions

A strong rollout is driven by the right people:

| Role               | Responsibility                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Executive Sponsor**  | Drives Mixpanel adoption by securing resources, removing roadblocks, and ensuring alignment with company goals.                                                     |
| **Team Leads**         | Leads Mixpanel adoption within their team by setting KPIs, providing training and resources, and reinforcing data-driven decisions through regular use of Mixpanel. |
| **Mixpanel Champions** | Enthusiastic Mixpanel advocates who inspire peer adoption, answer questions, provide training, and share best practices.                                            |

Encourage each team to nominate a *Mixpanel Champion* who can model usage and surface success stories.

üëâ **Do this next:** Establish a cadence‚Äîmonthly data reviews or shared ‚Äúinsight of the week‚Äîto keep Mixpanel relevant.

## Communicate the Launch

Treat your rollout like a product launch. Build excitement, show value, and invite participation.

**Before Launch**

- Share a message from your sponsor or product lead explaining why Mixpanel is being introduced.
- Preview what teams will gain (‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be able to answer questions like where users drop off in signup").
- Point to a ‚ÄúStart Here‚Äù dashboard and short walkthrough.

**Launch Day**

- Host a short demo or all-hands to introduce Mixpanel.
- Encourage each team to explore one key report.
- Celebrate first discoveries in Slack or during standups.

**After Launch**

- Share early insights (‚ÄúWe discovered our activation rate doubled after signup simplification‚Äù).
- Ask for feedback and use it to refine your dashboards or events.
- Reinforce success in monthly reviews.
