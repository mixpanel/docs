## 1. Start with the Fundamentals

3. Highlight the [Mixpanel Community](https://community.mixpanel.com/) for Q&A and inspiration from peers.

4. Review training videos on [Mixpanel's Core Reports](/guides/guides-by-topic/core-reports).

## 2. Tailor Training by Role

Different teams use Mixpanel differently; PMs ask questions, engineers instrument data, analysts interpret results.

**Steps to take:**

1. Identify each team's Mixpanel use cases.
2. Pair each with relevant public resources (Docs, Community posts, blogs). Here are a few to get you started:
    - **PMs & Analysts:** [Insights](/docs/reports/insights), [Funnels](/docs/reports/funnels), [Retention](/docs/reports/retention), [Cohorts](/docs/users/cohorts), [Experiments](/docs/experiments).
    - **Engineers:** [SDK setup](/docs/quickstart/install-mixpanel), [Event tracking](/docs/quickstart/capture-events), [Feature Flags](/docs/featureflags).

<Callout type="info">
    **Pro tip:** Create internal ‚Äúoffice hours‚Äù where each team shares how they are using Mixpanel and what they have learned.
