## Overview

Unlike some other analytics tools which are limited to tracking pre-defined measures of engagement, such as page views and browser sessions, Mixpanel employs an event-based, user-centric model that tracks the specific actions that individual users take within your product.

This event-based approach to analytics captures a deeper understanding of user engagement, which allows for more granular analysis and effective targeting of messages and experiments.

As for the actual structure of the Mixpanel data model, it is built on three key concepts: events, properties, and user profiles.
