## Setting Up Mixpanel

### Mixpanel Organization
Each Mixpanel customer is assigned an [Organization](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020461952#organizations-introduction) which serves as the controlling entity for managing all your Mixpanel analytics needs.

- [Pricing / Billing Plan](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/categories/115000963103#billing-and-plans) - determines data volume limits and features available across all projects in the organization
- [Mixpanel Project(s)](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/categories/115000963103#project-configuration) - container for product's analytics data (events, properties, user profiles, reports, etc.)
- [User Account(s)](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/categories/115000963103#account-and-organization) - used to sign into Mixpanel given the appropriate role for organization and project level access
- Other organization settings - [teams](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020731831-Create-and-Manage-Teams), [service accounts](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/service-accounts), [access security (SSO/ 2FA)](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/categories/115000963103#access-and-security), [data & privacy](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/sections/115001299023-Data-Security-and-Privacy), etc.

### Mixpanel Projects
Each Mixpanel organization contains one or more [Projects](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004505106-Create-and-Manage-Projects) that house events, properties, user profiles, and other reporting metadata that can be created with EU data residency if applicable.

- [Timezone](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004547203-Manage-Timezones-for-Projects-in-Mixpanel) - [dates](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004547063#date) (including timestamps) are ingested in UTC and converted to the projectâ€™s configured timezone for reporting. 
- Access Keys
  - [Project Token](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004502806) - used solely for ingestion to identify (not authenticate) a project when collecting data in front-end implementations (client-side SDKs or Ingestion API)
  - [API/Project Secret](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004490503#api-secret) - legacy authentication for importing and exporting data, Service Accounts are the preferred and should be used where possible as API SDecret will be deprecated over time
- Other project settings - [group keys](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025333632#implementation), [data views](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043782572), [service accounts](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/service-accounts), [public dashboard](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402022733844), [sessions](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004695223), etc.

#### Create at least 2 Mixpanel Projects (Production and Development)
Mixpanel recommends tracking 1 product with multiple platforms (mobile, web, etc.) into one project, but [separate projects for development and production](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001354886-Automatically-Separate-Development-Data). There may be [factors](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004491683-When-To-Use-Multiple-Projects#factors-to-consider) where implementing separate projects is required, please refer to the Mixpanel Help.

### Mixpanel User Accounts
Each Mixpanel user account belongs to an organization and may be assigned with multiple projects with varying permissions / roles.

- [Organization Role](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025387911-Organization-Roles-and-Permissions) - each user will have a single organization role per organization
  - Owner (at least one) - super user for the organization and all projects underneath
  - Admin - manage projects, members, and roles in the organization (with [certain exceptions](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025387911-Organization-Roles-and-Permissions#admin))
  - Billing Admin - primarily for managing Billing Plans 
  - Member - *basic membership* for a user to have access to Project(s) and or Team(s)

- [Project Role](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024613412-Project-Roles-and-Permissions-) - each user can have multiple project roles, where it conflicts [permissions are additive](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024613412-Project-Roles-and-Permissions-#having-multiple-roles-at-once)
  - Owner - super user for the project, default for organization owners
  - Admin - manage project (except delete, reset, and security) and members within, default for organization admins
  - Analyst - create, save, edit reports + share and make public dashboards (*most common role for users*)
  - Consumer - create, save, edit reports but unable to share or create public dashboards

#### User Access Management Approach
There are two general approaches to user management in Mixpanel

#### Using Mixpanel Teams
Mixpanel enables assignment of projects and project roles to groups of users called [Teams](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020731831-Create-and-Manage-Teams) with the flexibility to also assign such projects and project roles to individual user accounts if required.

#### Basic User Account Setup
Organization Owners and Admins can assign projects or teams directly to user accounts at the organization level by minimally provisioning them with an organization Membership.

Project Owners and Admins can be created to delegate access provisioning privileges at the project level. A [default project role](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020731811-Invite-and-Manage-Users#setting-a-default-role-on-a-project) can also be set for All Users in the Organization as a baseline access. Teams are not available at the project level.

#### Single Sign-On (SSO) and 2FA
Mixpanel provides [Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036428871-Single-Sign-On) access to enterprise accounts using either an [Identity Provider (IDP)](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036428871-Single-Sign-On#set-up-your-idp) or a custom SAML implementation such as [Okta](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004474143) or [Microsoft Azure](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040323292).
- Enabling [Just in Time (JIT)](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036428871-Single-Sign-On#just-in-time-provisioning) provisioning using SAML removes the need for organization admins to invite individual users to an organization. 
- IDPs (Okta, Onelogin, and Azure) that have auto-provisioning integrations with Mixpanel enables syncing of access provisioning and deprovisioning for users.
- To give provisioned users default access to projects, invite all users in the organization by [Setting a Default Role on a Project](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020731811-Invite-and-Manage-Users#setting-a-default-role-on-a-project).

Mixpanel also provides [Two Factor Authentication (2FA)](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004485966-Two-Factor-Authentication-2FA-) feature requiring users to provide a security code sent via SMS to their configure mobile number to verify their identity.
