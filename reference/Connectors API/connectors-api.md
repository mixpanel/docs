> ❗️ Cloud Import
> 
> This API is now in maintenance mode and we are not accepting any new projects. We strongly recommend using the cloud ingestion methods outlined in the guides below:
> [Amazon S3](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-methods/integrations/amazon-s3)
> [Google Pubsub](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-methods/integrations/google-pubsub)
> [Google Cloud Storage](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-methods/integrations/google-cloud-storage)
> [Snowplow](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-methods/integrations/snowplow)
> [Stripe](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/tracking-methods/integrations/stripe)
>
> It is easy to integrate Mixpanel even if you use tools that we don't explicitly list here, like Spark, Airflow, Prefect, Dagster, or Kafka. Ultimately, all of these ingestion methods boil down to hitting our simple, scalable [HTTP APIs](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/ingestion-api) using the tools that you're most familiar with.
