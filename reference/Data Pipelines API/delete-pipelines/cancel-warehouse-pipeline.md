  excerpt: >-
    For a given pipeline name, this request deletes the pipeline and stops any
    future jobs to be scheduled for the pipeline.  Deleting the pipeline will
    result in the loss of all its historical data. If you wish to retain the
    history, it is recommended to pause the pipeline instead.
