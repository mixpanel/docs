title: Download Data
excerpt: >-
  Every data point sent to Mixpanel is stored as JSON in our data store. The raw
  export API allows you to download your event data as it is received and stored
  within Mixpanel, complete with all event properties (including distinct_id)
  and the exact timestamp the event was fired.

  The raw export API has a rate limit of 60 queries per hour, 3 queries per
  second, and a maximum of 100 concurrent queries. If you exceed the rate limit,
  a 429 error will be returned.
