The Mixpanel Export Data APIs allow you to export your raw data either manually or through a pipeline.

Example usage:
* If you receive a spike of 10K events but notice that only a few users contributed to it and would like to compare the data to another source.
* If you are exporting events from one project and importing them into another.
* If you are doing some very custom analysis Mixpanel cannot currently do. If this is the case, please [contact support](https://mixpanel.com/get-support) so we can either improve our product or possibly show you how you can perform this analysis within Mixpanel.
