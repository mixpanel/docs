excerpt: "Track events to Mixpanel from client devices. We recommend using one of our client-side SDKs instead of using /track directly, as our SDKs provide queueing, retrying, batching, and more.\n***\n[block:api-header]\n{\n  \"title\": \"When to use /track vs /import\"\n}\n[/block]\nTypically, we recommend using /import for server-side integrations as it is more scalable and supports ingesting historical data. We only recommend /track for client-side tracking in an environment for which we don't have SDK support or if you're sending data via some other untrusted environment (eg: third-party webhooks that send data to Mixpanel).\n[block:parameters]\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"h-0\": \"\",\n    \"h-1\": \"/track\",\n    \"h-2\": \"/import\",\n    \"0-0\": \"Events per request\",\n    \"0-1\": \"50\",\n    \"0-2\": \"2000\",\n    \"1-0\": \"Authentication\",\n    \"1-1\": \"Project Token, intended for untrusted clients.\",\n    \"1-2\": \"Project Secret, intended for server-side integration.\",\n    \"2-0\": \"Compression\",\n    \"2-1\": \"None\",\n    \"2-2\": \"Gzip allowed\",\n    \"3-0\": \"Content-Type\",\n    \"3-1\": \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\",\n    \"3-2\": \"application/json or application/x-ndjson\",\n    \"4-0\": \"Ingesting historical events\",\n    \"4-1\": \"Last 5 days only.\",\n    \"4-2\": \"Any time after 1971-01-01.\"\n  },\n  \"cols\": 3,\n  \"rows\": 5\n}\n[/block]\n\n[block:api-header]\n{\n  \"title\": \"Limits\"\n}\n[/block]\nThe limits for track are the same as /import, [see here](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/import-events#rate-limits)."
