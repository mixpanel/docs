    Send a batch of group profile updates. Instead of sending a single JSON
    object as the data query parameter, send a JSON list of objects as the data
    parameter of an application/x-www-form-urlencoded POST or GET request body.


    Refer to the respective group profile update commands ($set, $set_once,
    $add, $union, $remove, $unset, and $delete) on syntax for their parameters.
