Mixpanel's Ingestion APIs allow you to send event or profile data to Mixpanel, which can be analyzed in our reporting interface. 

If you're implementing client-side, we recommend using one of our SDKs. If you're implementing server-side, as part of a batch or streaming data pipeline, these APIs can be used as a low-level foundation to send data to Mixpanel.

See our [Client-Side vs Server-Side Tracking](https://docs.mixpanel.com/docs/getting-started/plan-your-implementation#need-to-start-tracking-product-data) guide for tradeoffs between the different integration approaches.
