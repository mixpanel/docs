    Permanently delete the profile from Mixpanel, along with all of its
    properties. The $delete object value is ignored - the profile is determined
    by the $distinct_id from the request itself.


    If you have duplicate profiles, use property $ignore_alias set to true so
    that you don't delete the original profile when trying to delete the
    duplicate (as they pass in the alias as the distinct_id).
