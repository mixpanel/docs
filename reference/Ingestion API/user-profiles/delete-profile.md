title: "Delete Profile"
slug: "delete-profile"
excerpt: "Permanently delete the profile from Mixpanel, along with all of its properties. The $delete object value is ignored - the profile is determined by the $distinct_id from the request itself. 

If you have duplicate profiles, use property $ignore_alias set to true so that you don't delete the original profile when trying to delete the duplicate (as they pass in the alias as the distinct_id)."
