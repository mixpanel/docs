    Send a batch of profile updates. Instead of sending a single JSON object as
    the data query parameter, send a JSON list of objects as the data parameter
    of an application/json POST or GET request body.


    Refer to the respective user profile update commands ($set, $set_once, $add,
    $union, $append, $remove, $unset, and $delete) on syntax for their
    parameters.
