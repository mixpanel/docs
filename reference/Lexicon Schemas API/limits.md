The Schemas API has the following limits:

- requests per organization per minute: 5
- events and properties updated per organization per minute: 4000
- total truncations/deletions per request: 3000

If you are running up against these limits, we suggest breaking your request into smaller batches. Usually these limits are only hit if you are attempting to do a bulk create/update.
