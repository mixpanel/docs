Most of our APIs require authentication for which we recommend using [Service Accounts](ref:service-accounts) to authenticate. However, most of our [Ingestion API](ref:ingestion-api) calls such as [Import Events](ref:import-events), [Track Events](ref:track-event), [User Profiles](ref:user-profiles), and [Group Profiles](ref:group-profiles) only require a [Project Token](ref:project-token). Because these APIs are often called from our client-side SDKs, we do not want to expose credentials, but we do need to know which project to send data to so we use the Project Token for that purpose.
