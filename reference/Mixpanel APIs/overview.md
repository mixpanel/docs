Mixpanel supports API endpoints that can query, export, and import data as well as manipulate Mixpanel metadata (such as data definitions).

The API endpoints are organized by the function that they support. The API structure is as follows:

### [**Ingestion API**](ref:ingestion-api) 
**Standard Server:** `api.mixpanel.com`
**EU Residency Server:** `api-eu.mixpanel.com`
Use the Ingestion API to get your data into Mixpanel. This includes live events, historical imports, and user profile data.


### [**Query API**](ref:query-api) 
**Standard Server:** `mixpanel.com/api`
**EU Residency Server:** `eu.mixpanel.com/api`
Use the Query AP to get the same calculated data the powers Mixpanel's web application. This includes Insights, Funnels, Retention, and custom JQL Queries.

### [**Raw Data Export API **](ref:raw-data-export-api) 
**Standard Server:** `data.mixpanel.com/api/2.0/export`
**EU Residency Server:** `data-eu.mixpanel.com/api/2.0/export`
