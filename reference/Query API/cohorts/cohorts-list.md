The list endpoint returns all of the cohorts in a given project. The JSON formatted return contains the cohort name, id, count, description, creation date, and visibility for every cohort in the project.

If you're trying to get a list of users in a cohort, you can use the [`/engage` endpoint with the `filter_by_cohort` parameter](ref:engage#engage-query).
