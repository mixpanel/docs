The Query API allows you to obtain the same calculated and formatted results that you see from a report in our web app.

The query endpoints should serve as the starting point for exporting user information from Mixpanel. This is done through the /engage endpoint. See the Export section for information on exporting event data.

The Mixpanel Query API endpoints can:

* Filter or break down Events
* Return user profiles.
* Return an activity/event stream for a user.
* Return a cohort of users.
* And more!
